The council meeting at Hawkik was a gathering of powerful adventurers and nobles, all brought together in a large round table meeting room in a stronghold. Among those present were Silvius, a bard carrying a rapier and wearing breastplate armor who was known for his striking good looks. Also present were Noble-Karasin of Innspa, who sat next to his Noble- Herzog Grenell of North Province, and Czolg, a huge human barbarian carrying a spear, who was on the opposite side of Herzog.

Aguan Dinead of Chauless, a wizard wearing a long flowing robe and carrying a staff, was also present, as was Kalinar, a half-orc wearing light armor and a long robe, who seemed slightly annoyed with being there. Human Noble- Duke Grenowin of Ulek and Fenurris, a ranger with a long bow, rounded out the group. The leader of the council was Noble-Grand Duke Owen I, who had been living in exile in Shiboleth, Gran March since 584 CY, due to the nation being overrun by giants during the Greyhawk Wars.

Aguan Dinead introduced himself to the group, and Kalinar jokingly referred to him as "ADC". Grand Duke Owen welcomed the team and stressed the importance of their mission to stop the giants and the attacks that had been happening across the lands. He then informed the group that he would be giving each of them an item to help them on their way.

Oscorn, a cleric carrying a warhammer and dressed in full plate, used his detect magic spell to inspect the items, but Kalinar, annoyed that Oscorn was trying to get information on the best magical item, countered his spell. The team members each selected an item, with Silvius choosing a silver ring, ADC a platinum crown, Fennuris a 63 foot golden laced cord, and Oscorn and Kalinar each receiving a bag of treasure.

Grand Duke Owen warned the group that all of the items were to be kept on separate people, as a power overload from the magic within these items could be catastrophic to the party. He then explained that the team would use the items to travel to a plane where they could use a beacon to contact their patrons.

Duke Own told the team to lay out the golden cord in a circle, making sure the ends were touching. In the center of the circle, three people must don the crown, ring, and bracelet. The crown was placed in the middle, with the ring on the right hand and the left hand on the left shoulder of the person wearing the crown, and the bracelet on the left hand with the right hand on the right shoulder of the person wearing the crown.

To activate the magic, the team would than need to recite the words "Facio, Voco, Ferre", which translated to "This I do, I call, to bring you forth". The plane would only hold for 8 hours every quarter moon (every 6 days), and returning from the plane would place the group in the circle of time of return to the exact area they projected from. The same number of beings that projected to the plane must return or disrupt the worldly balance.

He also explained that on the plane the team would find a beacon that they could use to call for aid and updates on their progress. 

Own then told the team they must leave at once. Oscorn suggested they stop by Midwood on the way, but the team was instead teleported to just outside Tycha town, where they were given a deer antler ritual to guide them to the Stags Crown, just outside of Tycha.
