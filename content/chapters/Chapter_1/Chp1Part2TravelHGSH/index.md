After teleporting to Tycha town, the team met with Gorok, a local guide, who would be leading them on their journey to find the hill giant stronghold. The team was each given horses to ride as they set out from Tycha town and made their way to a cave near the stronghold. Gorok explained that the cave was relatively safe and would be a good base for them as they prepared for their exploration of the stronghold.

Once they arrived at the cave, Gorok and his three companions welcomed the team and listened to their request to explore and understand the stronghold of the hill giant. Gorok explained that the stronghold was heavily guarded by a large number of giants and that it would not be an easy task. The team discussed their plan of attack, and decided to rest in the cave for the night before setting out to explore the stronghold the next day.

The team spent the night in the cave, preparing for the journey ahead. They sharpened their weapons, reviewed their tactics, and made sure that everyone had They equipment they needed. They were ready for the challenge that lay ahead.

The next morning, the team set out with Gorok. As they approached the stronghold, they could see that it was heavily guarded by a large number of giants. The team knew that it would be a tough journey, but they were determined to succeed.

With Gorok leading the way, the team were brought to the edge of a clearing where they could see a massive wooden structure with a thick thatched roof. It was earily quiet as Gorok said goodbye as he headed back to the cave leaving the team to make their first assalt.
