After taking the hill giant stronghold and saving the enslaved orcs from Nosnra, his hill giant battalion, and others from across the giant ordering, **we agreed to venture to the black ice to collect knowledge on the plans of the Jarl and prevent future attacks.**

Before leaving we gathered our friends Kazzug and knight elf and divided our **latest magical treasure**:
* Kalinar has **potions of invisibility and poison**
* ADC now has **Keoghtons ointment to heal and cure any disease**
* Oscorn with a **potion of fire breadth**
* Silivius with a <b><a href="DALL·E 2022-11-14 23.36.00 - A the back of a slender and pretty silver haired male elf holds a fancy lanterns facing the darkness_cleanup.png" data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="Silvius with a lantern of revealing that sheds light upon all that is visible and invisible">lantern of revealing that sheds light upon all that is visible and invisible</a></b>


We planned and prepared to go to the black ice by gathering wine barrels for a surprise delivery and Kalinar toasted to prepare himself for the glorious battle of magical patron pew pew pew.

As all were gathered and prepared, we set the magic chain in a figure 8 on the ground and headed to the black ice. The party experienced cosmic forces beyond comprehension on a journey that seemed 10x more vast then planned and landed us 5 miles down from the mountain edge as we experienced the sounds and sights of an ancient god. (aka **leveled up to 12** watching Buck Rogers)

We appeared on a snowy mountain side with our magical chain vanished.  Fennuris, remembering where she is from, discovered a trail of footprints to the foot of a glacier. **We found an empty cave we would return to if facing certain doom and a 5 foot crack appearing to go deep into the glacier.**

**We entered the crack** and followed it's fork to the east. The crack opened up to a vast frozen wind-whipped valley. Ledges and caves appeared to be on both sides and a path to the bottom of the valley to the northwest corner. We made our way on the eastern wall banded together holding a rope to secure us from a fall to the bottom of the 200'+ cliff. We walked past one set of caves continuing on the cliff edge until coming to a dead end of the narrow path dropping steeply down to the valley below.

Next to the dead end, we came across another cave that was silent and lit.

 We entered and found several dead and frozen heroes that came before us. They were presented along the walls as trophies, many glowing with magic. We tried melting and cutting out their potential gifts to us but it caused the ceiling to collapse alerting others from deeper within the cave.

Five wolves appeared and Czolg faced off against them. The rest of us joined the fight using the fury of our gods, patrons, and weapons. ADC summoned a frightful construct causing several dogs to flee in terror. The wolves fought fiercely with their bites, claws, and freezing breadth. One wolf fled back along the path we came in on while the others stood firm and received the deaths they requested.

We find ourselves now in a moment of eerie calm. Unknown dangers and treasure in front of us and a wolf likely alerting even more dangerous enemies behind us. So we ask ourselves:
Do we track down and kill the wolf?
Is the mystery magic and treasure worth the risks?
How do we prepare for what the wolf may bring?
