     The battle raged on around Oscorn as he struggled to free himself from the grip of the telekinetic force that had pulled him out into the open. He felt the rope around his belt grow taut as Silvius anchored him to the rope, preventing him from being pulled any further.
     <br>
     <br>
Kalinar leapt into action, jumping up onto an invisible wall of force and shooting at the magical force beneath his feet as Silvius shot him a face-palm stare. ADC joined the fray, running up to an Ogre and killing it by taking advantage of his wounds by tolling the dead.

Oscorn fought back against the Ogre in front of him, using the power of his god to strike at the creature until it fell at his feet. He took a moment to catch his breath and survey the battlefield, taking in the chaos and destruction all around him.

Suddenly, a new threat emerged. The Prince of Darkness, now a human-sized figure wielding a glaive that he swung at Oscorn with deadly precision. Oscorn narrowly dodged the worst of the attack and scrambled to his feet, ready for the next strike.
 <br><br>
 Silvius, never one to back down from a challenge, viciously mocked the next Ogre that approached, goading it into attacking him. The creature, enraged by Silvius' taunts, swung its massive club at him, but Silvius was ready and easily sidestepped the attack.

   The Frost giant roared and swung its massive fist at Oscorn, barely grazing his arm as he ducked out of the way. The telekinetic force pulling at him grew stronger, threatening to drag him further into the fray.
     <br>
     <br>
Oscorn gritted his teeth and fought back against the giants, determined to survive and protect his friends. He knew that they were all in this battle together, and that they would emerge victorious if they worked together and fought with all their might.

Kalinar raised his hand and cast a powerful enervation spell, putting piercing tentacles of inky darkness into the Prince of Darkness. The tentacles drained the life from the prince, weakening him with each passing moment.
<br><br>
ADC summoned Slad, a powerful creature that immediately began attacking the Prince of Darkness and the other monsters on the battlefield. Oscorn, still caught in the grip of the telekinetic force, misty stepped back up onto the invisible wall of force, but he was still within the grasp of the giants.

Silvius, seeing that Oscorn was in trouble, grabbed the rope from Fenuirs and jumped up onto the wall of force. He quickly again tied off the rope around Oscorn's belt, securing him in place. Silvius then closed his eyes and prayed for sanctuary, hoping to protect himself from the dangers around them.

    The Frost giant swung its massive axe at Oscorn again as Silvius tried to distract the giant with a well-placed taunt. Meanwhile, Kalinar continued to hurt the Master of Darkness with his inky tentacles, weakening the creature as time passed.
<br><br>ADC shouted, "I'm casting a spell that is kind of tiring! I wouldn't be doing this if I thought I could make it out of here without you!" His words were met with determination from his friends, who knew that they needed to work together to survive.

Suddenly, the Stone giant slung and hit Silvius with a massive boulder. Silvius held his concentration, determined to keep his spell active despite the pain to keep the wall of force in place and continue providing a valuable shield for his friends. 
 <br><br>
 Fenuirs ran forward and shot an arrow around ADC, taking out an Ogre that was threatening his friend. Kalinar, however, was not so lucky. He was hit with an Ogre's club, a brutal blow that smashed his upper right arm and left him severely injured.

Oscorn, seeing that the situation was becoming increasingly dangerous, ran back and jumped off the invisible wall of force. He hid behind a nearby rock, hoping to catch his breath and regroup with his friends.

Czolg, wielding Panzerfaust with deadly precision, killed an Ogre with a well-placed strike. Silvius, seeing an opportunity, jumped back into the dragon's lair and landed on the ground. He began to mock an Ogre, goading it into attacking him.

A Cloud giant appeared and chased Silvius, its massive form casting a mist around the wall of force.    

Fenuirs continued to shoot arrows at the Stone giant, and managed to disarm an Ogre that was threatening ADC. The Ogre's club fell to the ground, but not before it hit ADC with a vicious blow. The Ogres continued to attack, hitting Slad and threatening to overwhelm the group. 
  
As the stone giant wound up to swing, Czolg reached for a deep black, obsidian stone hanging from his neck. Upon hit, Czolg invoked the powers of a once great cloud giant. The energy from his strike transformed into a swirling orb of wind that flew towards the Prince of Darkness and struck him dead. 

Oscorn, desperate for a break in the beating, begged for a moment of peace. Czolg, hearing his friend's plea, killed another Ogre and then turned to the Stone giant, stabbing it with his spear as he yelled "I'm working on it!" 

The battle raged on as Silvius cast another wall of force, pushing the Frost giant up into the air and the Stone giant down to the ground. The giants struggled against the magical barrier, but Silvius held them in place with his powerful magic.

Kalinar, meanwhile, killed an Ogre with a series of magical blasts, each one striking true and taking out another of the monstrous creatures. The Stone giant tried to crawl away, but Fenuirs volleyed arrows at him with her bow.

The Ogres knocked sSlad down and beat Slad to death as he lay on the ground, unable to defend himself. Czolg attacked a Stone giant and stabbed it, but it continued to crawl away, determined to escape. Silvius, seeing this, used his fire sword to stab the giant in the butt, finally stopping its escape.

The Cloud giant and Kalinar discussed the situation, with Kalinar suggesting that they could talk with Jarl to resolve their differences. The Cloud giant, however, denied the idea, insisting that this could only end in the teams death at the hands of the giants.

The Stone giant tried to crawl away again, but Czolg stopped it and stopped it with a Panzerfaust strike. Fenuirs killed another Ogre with her bow, and Czolg continued to stab the Stone giant. Kalinar used his tentacles to slap an Ogre to death, finally finishing off the remaining creatures.
  
ADC cast a wall of ice that cut the Stone giant in half, sending the massive creature crashing to the ground. The Cloud and Frost giants, seeing that they were outnumbered and outmatched, started to flee from the battlefield. Oscorn quickly held the frost giant in place with his divine magic.

Fenuirs held her arrows and shot at the Frost giant as it fled, but the creature was too fast and managed to dodge her attacks. The Frost giant, injured and distracted by arrows, was quickly finsihed off by Silvius' flaming sword.
  
"I lost my hold!" screamed Oscorn, as the Cloud giant managed to slip away from Oscorn's devine hold. "I can't stop him!" Kalinar shouted, slamming the giant with eldritch blasts in an attempt to slow it down. The cloud giant sprinted off seeming determined to warn the others. Czolg charged at the cloud giant to catch up to it and strike it down.

Silvius, seeing that Czolg was struggling to catch the giant, ran up to him while grabbing Panzerfaust from the ground. He teleported in front of the Cloud giant, surprising the creature with his sudden appearance. 

Oscorn, seeing the cloud giant may escape and bring more giants to the fight, threw his javelin of lightning at the Cloud giant, striking it with a powerful blast of energy. Czolg attempted to stop the cloud giant with a strike from Panzerfaust, but it was too late. The Cloud giant misty stepped and continued running deeper in to Jarl's stronghold.
  
Can the team stop and kill the cloud giant? Will they survive another wave of giants and enemies? Will they find a place to regroup and recover from the battle? We'll find out next time.
