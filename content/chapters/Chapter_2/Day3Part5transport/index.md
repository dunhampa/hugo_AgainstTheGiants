As Silvius traveled through the astral plane, he prayed to Ilmater. 

"Hello, my son. What brings you to me?" the deity asked.

Silvius took a deep breath before speaking. "I nearly killed us all," he said, his voice heavy with shame.

Ilmater chuckled. "True. However, you did not. The question should be why," he said.

Silvius hesitated for a moment before replying. "Why did I nearly kill my team and myself, or why did we survive?" he asked.

"Perhaps both," Ilmater said.

Silvius hung his head. "I'm too weak," he said. "Ilmater, I pray to you. Grant me the strength to defeat these enemies so we can bring peace to Innspa and across the lands," he said, his voice filled with desperation.

Ilmater broke out in a hearty yet gentle laugh. "Silvius, when have you served our purpose well through your strength?" he asked.

Silvius thought back to all the battles he had fought and the role he had played in each one. He thought of the bandits attack on the shipment from the Harp, and how he and his friends had fought bravely to push them back. He thought of Kalinar leaping over the giant's trap into Nosnra's secret room, and how he had found the path to the room and blocked Nosnra from entering and killing them both.

He thought of fighting to free the Orcs from the bugbears, and how the Orcs had fought with their lives and the weapons he had given them. 

He thought of the scalebacks charging him, and how the shots from Kalinar and the spirits of Ilmater had weakened them to the point of near death. 

He thought of the flaming ice centipede nearly devouring Oscorn, and how Fennuris, Kalinar, ADC, and Czolg had quickly dropped the beast and how Oscorn had kept all of them alive.

He thought of the times he had laid out powerful treasure before his friends, and how they had agreed on who would be best served by the power in each gift. He thought of the strikes from Czolg with Panzerfaust, the bolts of lightning from Oscorn's javelin, and the ice from ADC's staff.

"Silvius, what are the most powerful gifts I have given you personally to use on your quest? A light that can see all things and a sword that flames," Ilmater said.

“And the power in the sword you given me isn’t in the heat of its flame but in the light that it shines for others on where I strike”

Ilmater smiles. “Well that and flaming swords are just really cool” 

Ilmater continued…

“Our path is not one of might through muscle or magic. It is not one of restoring what is lost or gone. It is not one of gathering wealth or power for our vision of the future. Our path is to guide others along their paths. To help others find the balance of the shadows. It is for you to help guide and aid your friends on their paths as it is mine to guide and aid you on yours”

Silvius paused as he bowed his head. 

“ilmater, please guide me with your vision and support me with your aid so that I may guide others on their paths”

“Of course. I always have and will. And Remember Silvius, Even the deepest darkness is part of the shadows. many that seem gone are merely broken. Goodbye for now my son”
