The team appeared in front of a massive volcano with rivers of lava flowing down. There was a bridge 5 feet over a bridge of lava. On the far side of the bridge there were short platforms on either side of the bridge that appeared to be places for giants to greet others when they arrive.

Suddenly, a bright ball of light appeared and two frost giants materialized out of thin air. ADC reacted quickly, blasting ice all around the frost giants and covering the ground with jagged and slippery ice. The first giants shrugged off the cold but felt the slams of rock as they hit the ground.

Kalinar ran to the start of the bridge and fired eldritch blasts at the giants, while Czolg charged forward and stood between Kalinar and the frost giants, yelling about the ugliness of their mothers. Oscorn and Silvius joined Czolg, but stayed partially hidden behind the bridge's stone railing.

Fennuris unleashed a volley of arrows at the two frost giants, while ADC shot a bolt of fire at one of the giants. One arrow found its mark, but the other got stuck in the bowstring and smacked Fennuris in the head, knocking her unconscious.

As Kalinar attempted more eldritch blasts, his magic failed and he spent a few seconds shaking out his fancy hands. Meanwhile, the frost giants were sling boulders at Czolg, one of which smashed into him.

Oscorn called out, "Why would the Jarl want us?!? He sent us here! I think we're on the same side." But the frost giants just laughed and replied, "Jarl will rule this mountain as well as the black ice. You won't stand in his way."

Silvius ran back to where Fennuris lay unconscious and frantically tried to wake her up, smacking her and yelling, "This is what you were meant to do!! This is your moment!" 

Another flash of light and a stone and frost giant appeared. ADC summoned his beholder and shot fire and lasers at the frost giant in front of Czolg, while Czolg's rune glowed as he grew to giant size and attacked.

Oscorn yelled, "We are on the same side!" But the frost giant replied, "Jarl sent us. You will die!"

Fennuris woke up and Silvius ran back to the bridge, while Kalinar checked out the path to the south and summoned his cold tentacle. The frost giant slightly giggled as the tentacle attacked him.

The battle raged on, with lasers, fire, and arrows from the beholder, ADC, and Fennuris. Czolg struck the frost giant and knocked his battleaxe out of his hand and into the lava. Silvius mocked the frost giant and Kalinar killed it with eldritch blasts, while the tentacle tickled the next frost giant.

Another volley from ADC, beholderkin, and Fennuris hit the frost giant, and Czolg stabbed him. Silvius scared the frost giant, causing him to try to run, but Czolg stabbed him again.

Kalinar shot again and was at a loss for words why his magic was failing him again. Czolg smashed the frost giant with the end of his spear, stunning him and making him see stars. Silvius ran to the opposite side of the frost giant and stabbed him with his flaming sword. Finally, Kalinar delivered a booming stab and ran.

Another flash of light. A cloud giant and another frost giant appear. The beholder lasers the stone giant, but the stone giant answers back with a boulder, killing it.

Czolg stabs and kills the other of the first two frost giants, saying, "We're here to help you kill Snure." Silvius creates a wall of force and slides it under the cloud giant, causing him to fall into the lava.

The cloud giant attempts to Misty Step, but Silvius stops him. He then tries to roll out of the way, but Czolg stabs him with a Panzerfaust and pushes him over to the lava. Czolg's fire rune glowed as he stabbed the cloud giant over and over again as he stood above him on the bridge. The cloud giant burned in the lava, yelling in pain, and slipped beneath the molten rock.

Oscorn tolled dead on the frost giant as Silvius flaming stabbed the next one, surprised by his toughness and size. The frost giant tried to grab Silvius, but missed and ran past him. Silvius tried to strike again and missed as the frost giant passed him, then ran up to ADC and faced him.

Another flash of light signaled the arrival of two more frost giants on the bridge. The stone giant charged at Kalinar, and the tentacle smacked him. Kalinar ran back and was hit by the frost giant's axe as he passed. Czolg charged the newly arrived frost giants.

Silvius cast another wall of force and slid it under the two newly arrived frost giants. One rolled towards Czolg, while the other fell into the lava and took massive damage.

Will Jarl continue to send his minions and allies to defeat the team? Why is Jarl attacking? Who's side is he on? Why did Jarl send the team to Snure only to attack them? We'll find out next time.
