ADC had summoned his slaad to help fight the frost giant he faced. Kalinar cheared slaad's arrival and jokingly referred to it as salad. But their levity was short-lived as they as the stone giant swung his massive club at Silvius, missing him by inches. The second strike nearly critically hit Silvius, if not for the intervention of Czolg who deflected the blow. Meanwhile, Kalinar used his magic to reduce the power of the strike.

Czolg quickly and repeatedly stabbed the frost giant in front of him. Oscorn ran to Silvius's side and cast beacon of hope and prayed for sanctuary.

Silvius prayed to Ilmater for protection and cast spirit guardians, hitting both the stone giant and the frost giant. 

The frost giant that had fallen in to the lava and already nearly a skeleton from the molten rock, crawled out and hit Kalinar.

But Kalinar was not one to be underestimated even as he faced two towering giants, and he quickly stabbed the stone giant with his dagger, killing him. Suddenly, a flash of light appeared, and another stone giant, Jarl, and Jarl's wife Estia materialized. Jarl looked around in confusion and shouted, "Braam is dead! Everything will fall apart without him!"

Jarl was immediately hit with Ilmater's protective spirits, but he fought on, determined to see his plan through. The ADC and his trusty salad, attacked the frost giant from opposite sides, while Fennuris, a half-elf ranger, shot arrows at the frost giant. 

Oscorn shouted at Jarl, "You sent us here, what are you doing?!" Jarl replied, "Your plan may give me the black ice, but mine gives me the world!" Oscorn cast a large heal on the team and urgently asked Silvius to back off the bridge.

Silvius hesitated, but ultimately decided to step towards Estia as he apologized to Oscorn. He cast a much stronger spirit guardians. Jarl hit Silvius twice to break the spell although Silvius remainede focused on his prayer. 

The frost giant near ADC screamed in blood lust as he crushed the slaad. Estia took two swings at Czolg with her massive morningstar. Kalinar, using his magic, waved his hands and caused the ground underneath Jarl and Estia to break apart, black tentacles breaking the surface from below.

The frost giant from the lava hit Kalinar, but Kalinar pointed back at him and flames erupted around the frost giant, dropping what was left of him.

"Ok, Jarl. You've chosen to die by fire!" Kalinar shouted as he lashed out at Jarl with black tentacles emanating from him, draining some of his life. ADC waved his staff and created a wall of ice, but the stone giant was able to dodge out of the way and jump to the center of the bridge.

Fennuris shot at Jarl again, but the arrows seemed to be pulled in by his glowing shield, missing the Jarl. Oscorn backed away from the Jarl and healed Silvius again, begging him to leave. Czolg struck the Jarl and knocked him down, striking him again on the ground.
