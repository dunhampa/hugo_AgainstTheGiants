Czolg took the lead, stabbing the ettin three times and killing it. ADC was not far behind, waving his staff and creating an ice storm on top of the giants near the throne. Meanwhile, the beholderkin moved forward and used its laser to attack the fire giant to the north.

Silvius taunted the fire giant and Czolg begain calling out to them to come out and face them. Suddenly, a deep, dark voice echoed through the room, saying "You wish us to comeâ€¦ we will come." A fire giant with a large crown stepped down from the throne and walked through a hidden door at the back of the room, followed by two more fire giants.

Silvius realized that they could come from anywhere, and as if on cue, hell hounds charged from the north. Czolg managed to stop one with Panzerfaust, but three others surrounded Silvius. The fire giants from the north each threw a boulder at Czolg, leaving him battered. "We may need to get back to the bridge," he said.

ADC's Beholder and Fennuris took aim at the hell hounds, with Fennuris dropping her weapon after the first shot, but she quickly caught it mid-air and fired two more shots, killing the hell hounds. Kalinar unleashed three blasts, killing another hell hound. Silvius prayed to Ilmater and killed yet another hell hound.

The two remaining hell hounds breathed fire, catching Czolg, Kazik, and Silvius in cross fire of flames. But Silvius held on to his prayer, and suddenly, more hell hounds poured out from behind a tapestry on the southern wall. They bit ADC, Fennuris, Oscarn, and the beholderkin, but Oscorn managed to use his "light of dawn" to burn the Snure and heal everyone, including Kazik.

Kalinar grabbed Fennuris and disappeared in a crack of thunder, reappearing near the tapestry where the hell hounds appeared. Silvius ran around the hell hounds, allowing Ilmater to lash out at each of them, also killing another hell hound. The hell hounds started to attack, but one was killed by Ilmater's spirits. The remaining hell hounds breathed fire at Silvius, ADC, Kazik, and Oscarn. "It's not safe!!" Kalinar yelled as he ran back to the group. "It wasn't safe here either!" ADC replied while putting out small flames on his robe.

Czolg crumbled a hell hound with his spear and then stabbed a fire giant, telling Oscorn "We need to go!" ADC waved his staff again, creating a wall of ice that separated three fire giants from Fennuris and Kalinar. Oscorn offered a quick way out for anyone who wanted it, and Czolg and the others began to fight their way out.

Silvius charged towards the throne, where he saw a hydra with 5 heads. He hit the monster with spirit guardians and disappeared, while the fire giants charged at the team, trying to break through the wall of ice. Oscorn used his toll the dead to kill another hell hound, and Czolg killed another one. Kalinar hit the hydra with vicious blasts, causing one head to explode and fall to the ground.

Czolg and the fire giants continued to trade blows, but Silvius and Kazik couldn't find how the fire giants were getting through the wall of ice. Suddenly, Czolg yelled, "There's a dragon over there!" 

Kalinar was the first to act, hitting the monster with a series of vicious energy blasts. One head exploded off and fell to the ground, but the stump soon grew into two new heads. Silvius and Kazik charged forward to engage it, while Czolg continued to trade blows with the fire giants.

Silvius and Kazik searched for the passage the Snure and hte other fire giants took, but the wall behind it appeared to be solid and impenetrable. Frustrated, they returned to the team. Meanwhile, Czolg and the fire giants continued their dance of death, each trying to land a blow. The fire giant was becoming increasingly angry, as it couldn't seem to land a hit on the nimble and quick Czolg.

Can the team make it out of the volcano and away from Snure's forces? Is this the wyrm Jarl warned the team about? Where is the bard going?
