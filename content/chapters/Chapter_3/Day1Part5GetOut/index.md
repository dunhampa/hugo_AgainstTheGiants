ADC cast a toll of the dead, which took its toll on the nearest fire giant. Kalinar and Fennuris shot magic and arrows at the same giant, while the hydra continued to charge at the team. ADC created an ice wall to hurt the giants and hydra.

Silvius tried to get past the wall where he saw the Snure and fire giants past with dimension door. He was knocked back and hurt. 

Czolg healed some of his wounds with a deep breath and speared the giant again. Oscorn cured more of Czolg's wounds, and told the team that if they needed to get out, they should come and touch him.

ADC summoned a mirthful fey in front of the hydra, but one of the hydra's heads quickly bit the fey. The fey, however, managed to charm the fire giant near ADC. The fey asked the giant if he could reign in his hydra buddy, to which the giant replied that it was the keeper's job and the union would be pissed. The fey then asked the giant if he could let the team pass through, to which the giant replied that they were just passing through and should be let go.

All the other fire giants paused in disbelief for a moment, then one of them yelled that the team had been killing everything. ADC looked at the charmed giant and said, "I'm going to hang with you," and hid between the giant's legs. 

Kalinar fired off three wild shots and smacked the hydra with his tentacle, causing one of its heads to fall off. But to their surprise, two more heads grew from the stump, and the hydra now had seven heads.

The hydra attacked Czolg, landing three bites, one of which hit him hard in the belly. Czolg groaned, "My tummy hurts." But Oscorn came to the rescue, curing his belly ache with a light rub. Czolg thanked Oscorn with a fart and a belch.

As they thought they were making progress, another five-headed hydra and another giant keeper burst through a hidden door that Silvius couldn't find. The new hydra bit and killed Kazik, but missed Silvius. One of its heads tried to pull the flaming sword from Silvius's hand, but it couldn't hang on to the flames. The fire giants yelled at the charmed fire giant, "Come on! Push 'em forward!" But the charmed giant ignored the other giants and stared at the fey with ADC hiding between his legs.

ADC remembered where he had heard of hydras before. He knew that hydras regenerated slowly and had a voracious appetite. He yelled to his friends, "We have to hit him hard quickly, but not too hard or quickly." The fey obeyed ADC's instructions and attacked the hydra multiple times. Two heads fell off, and the hydra fell to the ground dead. But to the team's surprise, the hydra got back up.

Fennuris exclaimed, "If we kill all the hydra heads, it dies." ADC confirmed, "Yes, that's what I said."

As Kalinar faced the first hydra, he shot out three powerful blasts, the monster dropped to the ground. But the victory was short-lived as the hydra quickly regained its strength and lunged at the fey, biting him twice. Czolg didn't hesitate and relentlessly stabbed the beast until it finally stopped moving.

"Burn it down!" Czolg yelled as Oscorn acted, throwing a bead from his necklace of fireballs. The resulting blast engulfed the hydra and the nearby fire giants in a massive inferno.

Meanwhile, Silvius had tried to save Kazik from the hydra's deadly jaws, but despite his efforts, he couldn't stop the monster from killing him. As Silvius ran back to his team, he saw the giant blast of fire in front of him and heard the keeper scream, "Nooo!!!"

ADC cheered, "My research is correct! Fire keeps the hydra from coming back!" The team retreated to the entry hall and ADC cast a wall of ice to hold back the advancing fire giants.

Kalinar, however, wasn't content with hiding behind the wall. With a powerful blast, he shattered the hole in the ice and charged forward, taking out a fire giant with ease. But the enemy was relentless and a fire giant sword sliced through the wall, threatening to pull back to the other side.

Silvius used his dimension door ability to reappear on the safe side of the wall with his friends. As he greeted his allies, a fire giant reached out to grab him, but missed as the giant's armor became stuck.

ADC, growing frustrated with the chaos, yelled, "What are you all doing in my blast zone? Back up!" Silvius, exhausted but still full of sass, mocked the fire giant as he walked up to Oscorn and said, "I'm ready to touch you now."

Oscorn, not in the mood for Silvius' antics, replied, "Not the time, Silvius."

Oscorn peeks through the crack in the door, and with a worried look on his face, announces, "There's another hydra!" Silvius nods in agreement, as he cleans the drool from the hydra's bites off his armor.

ADC sends his pocket fairy to scout ahead, but it's instantly smashed with a sword. "I guess murder holes work both ways," sighs Oscorn. Czolg, not discouraged by the setback, asks "Ok, so now we're ready to go blow the bridge, right?" Kalinar, with a laugh, retorts "Nobody has ever said that."

ADC quickly takes charge of the situation, healing Czolg with a potion. Although Czolg thanks ADC for the heal, he still feels tired. Kalinar repairs the ice wall with his icy tentacle, and Oscorn announces that it's time to leave.

The team walks out and ADC puts a magical lock on the door. Silvius creates a magical illusion of a pile of rocks to deceive any potential attackers, and ADC casts a spell to create a cozy hut for the team to rest in. Silvius then uses his magic to summon Kazik back, who roams around outside to keep watch.

Will the team rest safely? How will the Snure prepare for the team's return?
