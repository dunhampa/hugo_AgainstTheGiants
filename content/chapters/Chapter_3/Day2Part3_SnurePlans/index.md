As the group rested, Silvius inspected the six bone batons they had found and discovered that they had dwarfish runes inscribed on them. However, no one in the team could read them. Silvius approached Czolg, who was tending to his wounds, and asked if he spoke dwarfish. Oscorn rolled his eyes at Silvius's question as he helped Czolg with his injuries.

Meanwhile, Kalinar explained to Silvius what he saw while trying to open the other chest, and ADC offered magical guidance. Silvius successfully picked the lock on the chest and discovered 800 silver pieces inside, which Oscorn promptly stashed in his bag.

Silvius then informed the team that he couldn't hold the western door for much longer. Oscorn inspected the door and suggested that he could shape the surrounding stone to hold the door if they could get it closed. Fennuris and ADC prepared to shut one side of the door while Silvius got ready to shut the other side. Silvius dropped the wall of force and closed one side of the door while his friends closed the other, and Oscorn sealed it shut.

After securing the door, Silvius went to explore the room behind the southern tapestry and discovered a chest of drawers filled with hundreds of scrolls and parchments. He sat down to rest and began to peruse the papers, handing some out to the rest of the team as they took a break.

Most of the papers were instructions to the Snure on gathering all kinds of giants and other creatures and promising them a role in the new order if they helped take over. Oscorn found an interesting scroll from the "House of Elservs," and Fennuris found one signed by Ecvaldra, the Princess of Loth. Silvius found an odd paper written in Dwarvish, but no one in the group could read it.

As they were preparing and bandaging their wounds, they heard noises as giants tried to check the doors. Silvius gave Fennuris, ADC, and Oscorn a gift from Ilmater, eyes of night so they could see better in the darkness.

Silvius walked up to the northern door but couldn't hear much. Kalinar then said he could handle it and his eyes rolled back in his head as he slowly walked around the edges of the room. As Kalinar returned to normal, he informed the team that going north was the best option, although there were enemies past the door.

Silvius leans forward and lightly whispers "tickle corn" before jumping back behind the corner. The door pops open as Silvius commands it to, and blasts of magic and arrows fly out, ready to take down any enemies. One gnoll explodes from the attacks, while another is killed by Czolg's spear strikes.

Silvius runs across to the doors and sees a fire giant to the north. He insults the giant, and Czolg agrees with his taunts, trying to goad the giant to attack. The team hears giants yelling "the door is open! Move! Move! Move!" from the north, and boulders come slamming in, hitting Czolg.

Next, the door to the east breaks into pieces as three fire giants come bursting through the western door. Fennuris backs away from the giants and fires arrows at them, trying to take them down from a safe distance.

A hell hound runs up to Czolg and Oscorn, blasting them with flaming breath. Kalinar runs into the middle of the three fire giants and disappears in a blast of thunder, hurting all of them. ADC then blasts the three giants in the room with a cone of cold, and Oscorn tolls the dead.

Silvius looks to the remaining giants and hell hounds to the north and says, "Sorry, you all will need to wait your turn," before slamming the door in the confused hell hound's face. He then runs and ducks under the giant table in the middle of the room, waiting for his next move.

The giant takes three swings at Czolg, but one misses, and the other hits. As the giant makes his third swing, Silvius insults him by mocking his butt still stuck under the table. The giant misses, confused by Silvius' taunt.

Fennuris quickly shoots her bow, but it snaps in her face, surprising her. Kalinar steps forward, using his incredible speed to smack the giant with his tentacle, while ADC summons a construct to attack the giant in the northwestern corner.

Oscorn throws his javelin of lightning, hitting all three fire giants. Silvius prepares to strike the giant's exposed butt under the table, but Kalinar kills it with more blasts of magic. Waythe urges Silvius to go after the next giant, so Silvius charges out from behind the table and swings wildly. Waythe flies out of his hands, but Silvius catches it in mid-air and retreats behind Czolg.

Czolg shoves the fire giant in front of him down, and then kills him with Panzerfaust. The other two giants hear a call to pull back and run out the western door, grabbing the javelin of lightning as they leave.

Silvius looks around, still on edge from the battle, and says, "Well, I guess it's the northern giants and dogs' turn again." 

Team readies attacks as Czolg stands at the northern door ready to fight. Silvius again walks up to the door and whispers "tickle corn" and opens the door as he retreats behind a corner. Czolg charges forward and yells back "all clear!".

Fennuris thanks Czolg and runs out the northern door until she's stopped dead in her tracks by two boulders smacking her. ADC turns to his construct and says "They have rocks, best to burrow," but then looks down at the smooth solid obsidian floor and changes his mind, saying "No, no, best to not burrow here."

Silvius runs out the northern door and hides under the humanoid-sized table. As he's watching for giants, he hears a faint voice on the other side of the door to his north saying "hyena heads, what is going on?" in a non-giant voice.

Czolg taunts the giants to come fight him as he stands in the hallway. The giants say to each other "it's the big one!" "Shut up and move!"

Fennuris shoots the fire giant with her bow. Oscorn runs past the bench near the table Silvius is hiding under and flips it over, blocking the fire giants from Silvius, and tolls the dead on one fire giant. Kalinar blasts the weapon out of the nearest fire giant's hands and says "take us to Snure or we'll stack the bodies with the rest of your kin." The giants all ignore him.

ADC enters the room with the rest of the team and boasts, "Thank goodness I'm very strong." He then attempts to close the door behind him, but struggles to do so. "Summons, lend me a hand with this!" His construct tries to help, but they still can't budge the massive door.

Silvius uses magical force from beneath the table and manages to shut the door with ease. He chuckles and pokes fun at ADC. However, his laughter is interrupted by the loud clatter of a fire giant's sword hitting the bench, thanks to Czolg's swift kick.

Fennuris and ADC both take aim and shoot at the remaining fire giant, determined to bring the creature down.

How many more fire giants are coming to attack? Where did they take Oscorn's javelin? Who is in the room to the north? What is the house of Eilservs and the Princess of Loth? Why so much Dwarfish?
