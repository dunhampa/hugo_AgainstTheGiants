After emerging from Ombi the dwarf’s room, the team felt a renewed sense of purpose and energy. They had taken a much-needed rest, and now it was time to continue their exploration of the cavern.

Silvius and Kalinar moved toward the huts, opening the chests they found while Oscorn kept watch down the hall for any potential danger. In their search, they discovered two iron chests containing a significant haul:

900 gold pieces
A small satchel with 100 platinum pieces
A silver vase worth 500 gold pieces
A silver bowl worth 500 gold pieces
Kalinar swiftly placed all the treasure into his bag of holding, securing their newfound wealth. With their exploration yielding such valuable results, the team decided to take another long rest to prepare for whatever lay ahead.

During the rest, Kalinar’s eyes rolled back, and he moved around the room with a ghastly, ethereal gaze. Meanwhile, Silvius sent Kazik to scout ahead, and the quietness of the outside contrasted starkly with the room they had just left.

ADC, feeling antsy, remarked, “Where is my fey?”

Silvius, somewhat confused, replied, “It’s in the room.”

ADC, annoyed, clarified, “That’s a fairy, not a fey.”

Silvius, still puzzled, went back to checking more of the chests. Most contained items of a personal nature, but one locked chest held an assortment of wine and spirits. Kalinar, curious, decided to taste the wine to see if it was of any value.

Kalinar took a sip and immediately regretted it. The wine was absolutely disgusting, even by his standards. With a look of disgust, he threw the bottle down, and the shattering echo reverberated through the halls. The sound startled Oscorn, who immediately went on high alert.

Oscorn's keen eyes caught sight of part of a ballista down the hall. Realizing they might need some muscle, he motioned for Czolg to join him. Together, they moved cautiously toward the large weapon, ready for any surprises.

Back at the huts, Silvius and Kalinar continued their search, finding more gnoll-related items. Eventually, they stumbled upon a few more chests containing additional spirits and wine. Despite the foul taste, they decided to take a bottle each, thinking it might come in handy to throw on a fire if needed.

The team, invigorated by their recent discoveries, proceeded north down the hall. As they moved cautiously along the passage, they came upon a door on the east side. Fennuris, ever vigilant, found several large barrels of crude oil. Recognizing the potential utility of the oil, Oscorn came over to help Silvius investigate further.

Meanwhile, Czolg, ever practical, tipped over one of the barrels and began to roll it down the hall, just in case they needed to use it. As they continued their exploration, they discovered a burlap-wrapped bundle that glowed with a faint magical aura. Unwrapping it, they found a beautifully crafted longbow and 20 arrows, which Silvius promptly handed to Fennuris, knowing she would make the best use of them.

Czolg continued moving more barrels while Silvius opened a central door, revealing an old pen, now empty. Oscorn examined the room closely, even picking up and smelling some old dung. He deduced that animals had been there not too long ago.

ADC checked the longbow and arrows, confirming they were all +1 magical weapons. Oscorn then asked ADC to inspect a scroll they had found earlier.

As they ventured deeper into the area, they found what appeared to be a giant's bedroom. Inside, they opened a chest filled with typical giant-sized belongings. Nearby, they discovered a large kennel, which seemed to have been used recently.

Silvius continued his methodical search, finding a room hidden behind a tapestry. Within, he discovered a chest containing clothes, dried meat, and a bucket with a false bottom. Inside the hidden compartment were 20 platinum pieces, 8 gems, and 100 gold pieces.

Feeling a surge of inspiration, Silvius started to pray for a vision. His prayers were answered, revealing a glowing javelin among a pile of cloaks, throws, and furs. As he sifted through the pile, he found and retrieved a glowing sword and cloak.

ADC, intrigued by the dark cloak and shortsword they had found, sat down with them. Silvius addressed his intelligent, legendary sword, Waythe, asking, "If I were here before, there would be no giants left." Waythe's reply was as confident as ever, hinting at the sword's storied past.

ADC examined the cloak and determined it to be a Hellhound Cloak, which could be used to transform into a hellhound. He handed the +1 shortsword to Silvius and identified the javelin as a Javelin of Lightning.

As the team ventured further into the labyrinthine corridors, they entered another room where they were greeted by a human dressed in ordinary clothes but with strikingly bright blue eyes. He introduced himself as Aldon of Geoff.

Aldon explained his predicament to the team: "I was a scout, tasked with gathering information. Then I was captured, put in a sack, and taken through a portal. I felt time and space stretching around me, and when I emerged, I found myself here."

Kalinar shared his own experiences, describing the steading and the black ice they had encountered. Aldon shook his head, saying, "I don't remember those places. I was part of a previous spy group sent here on a mission."

Fennuris, ever the pragmatist, asked, "Why didn’t you open the doors or try to escape?"

Aldon replied, "I made it to the throne room but wasn't sure where else to go. The place is a maze, and danger lurks around every corner."

Their conversation was cut short as they focused on what lay ahead: a flaming sconce seeming to hover in the distance. As they moved closer, they realized the room was lit by several of these sconces and nicely decorated. 

They continued on until the found what looked to be a kitchen. As they entered the kitchen, they nearly stumbled into a chute covered in grease, leading to a long passageway below. From the heat emanating upwards, they guessed it to be a garbage chute.

ADC decided to send his fairy down the chute to investigate. The fairy descended, encountering increasing heat and a bright light at the bottom. It confirmed their suspicions: it was definitely a garbage chute.

After much deliberation, the team decided on a risky but potentially effective plan. They would try to sneak around the giants' prepared defenses and use the garbage chute to launch a surprise attack. Kalinar and Czolg would prepare to roll a barrel of crude oil down the main stairs as a distraction. Once the barrel was set in motion, Kalinar would join the rest of the team down the chute to ambush the giants.


"Kalinar, Czolg, get the barrel ready," Oscorn ordered. "Silvius, you'll go down the chute first. We'll lower you slowly."

Kalinar and Czolg nodded and headed off to retrieve the barrel, while Silvius approached the chute. He tied a sturdy rope around his waist, feeling the weight of the decision in his hands. With a deep breath, he began his descent, carefully navigating the turns in the slimy garbage chute.

The rope grew tighter as Silvius' weight increased, testing the strength of their makeshift plan. He could feel the garbage slime coating his hands as he held on, the unpleasant texture a constant reminder of the danger below. Above, Oscorn and Czolg were carefully lowering the rope.

As Silvius continued, Oscorn nearly lost his grip on the rope, but Czolg's quick reflexes saved it. Silvius sent a magical message to Oscorn, confirming he was still okay. "All good down here, keep it steady," his voice echoed in Oscorn's mind.

Czolg continued to lower the rope, his muscles straining with the effort. Suddenly, the knot holding Silvius began to come loose. Oscorn lunged to grab it, his heart pounding. He managed to catch the rope but couldn't maintain his hold as it slipped through his fingers.

Thinking quickly, Oscorn tried to shape the stone around the slipping rope with his magic. He missed. The rope slipped past, and Silvius plummeted down the chute.

Silvius felt the rush of air as he fell but invoked his magic, slowing his descent to the rate of a feather. As he emerged into the main room, he saw a pool of lava directly below. With a swift incantation, he created a magical Wall of Force, transforming his fall into a slide. The wall pushed a menacing troll, who had been waiting to ambush, into the pool of lava with a horrific screech.

Czolg was the first to leap down the chute after the falling rope, his massive form barreling through the narrow passage. Oscorn, quick to follow, jumped in right behind him. Kalinar hesitated for just a moment, casting a worried glance back up the chute before plunging in. ADC, taking a deep breath, finally followed suit.

Silvius, already at the bottom, was suddenly struck by a fire giant. "Help! Sliding down shit chute!" he yelled, trying to fend off the giant's attack.

One by one, the team slid down the chute. Silvius, seeing his friends coming down, cast Dimension Door and teleported back to the kitchen at the top of the chute. He quickly realized everyone was gone, so he jumped back down the chute to rejoin the fray.

As he re-entered the battle, the troll in the lava died with a final screech. Fennuris emerged from the chute and immediately fired his bow at the giants, his arrows finding their marks. Czolg, ready for action, grew in size and readied an attack.

Kalinar blasted the fire giant with a powerful spell, sending a shockwave through the room. Silvius summoned Kazik and quickly informed Oscorn, "I'm coming back down the chute!"

Czolg engaged a troll with his spear, pinning it in place. Oscorn, moving north, struck the troll and shouted, "One is held!"

With a mighty swing, Czolg landed a massive hit on the fire giant, followed by a critical strike with the back of his spear. ADC, casting a flame bolt, hit the held fire giant, adding to the onslaught.

Silvius slid down and ignited his flame shortsword, striking the troll. Kalinar dashed forward, blasting the troll again. The troll, struggling to stand, swiped at Oscorn with its claws, but Oscorn retaliated with a divine strike.

Fennuris, aiming true, shot the troll and killed it. Suddenly, a gnoll appeared and threw a spear, narrowly missing Silvius. More gnolls emerged, drawing their bows.

Czolg, unstoppable, ran forward and killed the spear-throwing gnoll with a powerful hit. He then turned his attention to the next gnoll. ADC, observing the chaos, asked, "Can we wait for them to come here?"

But Silvius, already in motion, ran at the gnolls and cast Spirit Guardians, summoning spectral protectors to aid in the battle. Kalinar, not missing a beat, unleashed another blast, targeting the remaining enemies.

---- 3/20 -----

Kalinar, seeing an opportunity, cast a spell that summoned black tentacles from the ground. The writhing appendages ensnared all nearby enemies, and one tentacle even managed to crush a gnoll instantly.

The fire giant struggled to break free from the tentacles, but Silvius mocked him with biting words, keeping him trapped. Two gnolls managed to escape the grasp of the tentacles, firing arrows at Czolg and Silvius, but all the shots went wide.

Fennuris, ever the sharpshooter, took aim and felled another gnoll with a well-placed arrow. Oscorn cast Toll the Dead on a wounded gnoll, melting it with necrotic energy, and then yelled out, "Move to the south!"

ADC commanded his earth elemental to attack, and the massive creature struck twice, dealing significant damage. Czolg, fighting fiercely with his spear, shouted, "We are surrounded. We may need to hold the rooms!"

Silvius ran into the room, his Spirit Guardians swirling around him. The spectral figures struck out at the gnolls, killing one and wounding another. Silvius then taunted a two-headed ettin, further demoralizing the enemy.

The troll that was previously ensnared by the tentacles remained stuck, struggling futilely. However, more trolls began to appear from the south, adding to the pressure.

Kalinar, focusing on the fire giant to the north, unleashed three Eldritch Blasts. Two of them struck true, causing the giant to roar in pain. The black tentacles, continuing their relentless assault, managed to strike an ettin.

The fire giant made another attempt to escape the tentacles but failed again. The ettin swung its battle axe at the earth elemental, but the weapon did little damage against the earthen form of ADC's summon.

Fennuris, losing his balance, fell over but still tried to shoot from the ground. Unfortunately, his shot went wide.

Silvius' Spirit Guardians continued their assault, causing more gnolls to drop lifelessly to the ground.

Oscorn sprinted out of the room, casting Toll the Dead on one of the ettins. The necrotic energy overwhelmed the creature, and it collapsed with a final groan. ADC then conjured an ice storm, targeting the remaining ettin and two trolls. The icy barrage battered them, slowing their movements and dealing significant damage.

Silvius, mounted on Kazik, maneuvered through the chaos, hitting the fire giant and a troll ensnared by the tentacles with his Spirit Guardians. He then rushed to Czolg’s side, mocking the remaining ettin with a sharp remark.

A troll approached Czolg, but the bugbear warrior was ready. He struck the troll, halting its advance. Another troll engaged the earth elemental, landing a heavy blow. The fire giant continued to struggle against the tentacles, unable to break free.

The ettin landed a powerful hit on the earth elemental, but the creature held firm. Fennuris took aim and fired a flaming arrow at one of the trolls, the arrow striking true and searing the troll’s flesh. Oscorn cast Toll the Dead on the ettin, adding to its mounting injuries.

ADC launched a fire bolt but missed his target. The earth elemental swung back at the ettin, but its attacks went wide. Silvius hurled a bottle of liquor at the restrained troll, missing his target but still managing to hit it with his Spirit Guardians. He then ran back south, dealing more damage to the trolls and killing one in the process.

A troll viciously attacked the earth elemental, breaking off a piece of its rocky exterior. Kalinar focused his magical blasts on the fire giant, which was still stuck in the tentacles. The dark appendages lashed out, striking a troll.

The fire giant made another desperate attempt to escape, finally breaking free for a moment before getting ensnared again, much to its frustration as Silvius continued to mock it.

Oscorn noticed a new threat and shouted, "The one to the south has a boulder!" Fennuris shot an arrow down the hall at something unseen, and moments later, they all heard a loud animal roar. A giant head, with a white face and white hair, poked around the corner.

Oscorn quickly threw a bead of fireball, but it fell short. Despite that, the explosion managed to hit a troll, kill the lion, and injure the cloud giant that had appeared.

Suddenly, a sickening radiance began to form. ADC, noticing a human casting a spell out of the corner of his eye, quickly countered it, stopping the spell from taking effect.

ADC cast Toll the Dead, and the earth elemental continued its relentless assault on the troll. Kazik, Silvius' loyal wolf, lunged at the cloud giant, sinking his teeth into its leg. Silvius followed up with a powerful strike from Waythe, injuring the giant further.

One of the trolls succumbed to the tentacles' grasp, and another was severely damaged by Silvius' Spirit Guardians. Kalinar hexed the cloud giant, intensifying its suffering. The fire giant remained trapped in the tentacles, struggling futilely.

Suddenly, another fire giant approached from the south, and a dark humanoid creature began casting a spell. ADC, quick to react, countered the spell, preventing it from taking effect. Fennuris took aim and fired an arrow at the caster, striking him.

The cloud giant, in a desperate bid to escape, tried to turn into mist, but Silvius prevented its escape. In a rage, the cloud giant killed Kazik and then moved towards Silvius. Oscorn shouted, "Keep the trolls there! They keep away the boulders!" He then turned to the cloud giant and sneered, "Why are you here with these lessors?"

Meanwhile, the caster to the north locked eyes with ADC and conjured black tentacles over ADC, Fennuris, and Oscorn. Oscorn was the only one caught in their grasp. ADC retaliated by creating a wall of ice, trapping the cloud giant and two casters within. The ice inflicted massive damage, causing the caster's tentacles to dissipate and the cloud giant to collapse.

Czolg charged forward, dodging the trolls' attacks. They missed their strikes, thrown off balance. Seizing the opportunity, Czolg struck a troll in the groin with the butt of his spear. As the troll bent over in pain, Czolg grabbed it by the head, holding it in place.

Silvius, riding Kazik's spirit form, attempted to strike the troll but missed. He then ran back towards the forge. However, in the chaos, Silvius was fatally wounded, and he collapsed, Kazik's spirit form dissipating into the ether.

----- 4/4 ------

The team charged through the poison cloud, determination etched on their faces. Silvius surged forward, leaving Kazik behind to ensure he stayed out of harm's way. As the poisonous mist dissipated, ADC dropped the wall of ice, revealing a new wave of adversaries: a fire giant, a hill giant, three Drow warriors, and eight gnolls, all poised for combat.

Quickly assessing the situation, ADC conjured another wall of ice, strategically isolating the gnolls from the more formidable giants and Drow. This gave the team a moment to focus on the immediate threat. Kalinar and Oscorn acted swiftly, combining their magical blasts and tolling the dead to kill one of the gnolls.

Czolg roared and charged past ADC, confronting the gnolls head-on. Fennuris, with precise aim, volleyed arrows into the gnoll ranks, weakening them significantly. Taking advantage of this, Kalinar unleashed a flurry of magical blasts, eliminating two more gnolls.

Silvius, his flaming short sword drawn, charged at the remaining gnolls, cutting one down with a swift, fiery strike. The gnolls, now preparing to counterattack, found themselves in disarray. A yellow cloud began to form again, obscuring the battlefield.

Arrows whizzed through the air towards Czolg, but Kalinar's summoned tentacle deflected them, preventing harm. Oscorn, recognizing the need for strategic repositioning, stepped back to assess the battlefield better.

Through a crack in the fog, ADC saw an opportunity. He cast Toll the Dead, the resonant chime of doom echoing through the mist. The gnolls reeled from the necrotic energy, their morale wavering under the relentless assault.

Silvius noticed movement to the north and shouted, “Get ready to fight to the north!” His voice echoed through the cavern, cutting through the tension.

ADC, keenly observing the poison cloud, tried to determine its source and duration. Czolg, realizing the danger they were in, shrank back down from his giant size and said, “We got to get out of this gas.”

“I’m charging these Drow,” Silvius declared, determination in his eyes.

Oscorn, trying a more mundane approach, waved his blanket in an attempt to disperse the fog. Meanwhile, ADC summoned an earth elemental. The massive creature moved effortlessly through the fog, despite being struck by two arrows. It reached the gnolls and swiftly eliminated two of them.

Czolg, undeterred by the poison, charged through the cloud. As he emerged, a boulder flew past him from the north, narrowly missing him.

Fennuris stayed back from the fog, keeping an arrow nocked and ready to fire. Kalinar, with a dramatic flair, charged through the fog and, with a wave of his hands, proclaimed, “Call off the attack and take us to Ecvaldra, or you’ll die like all the others!” However, the Drow showed no signs of compliance.

Silvius, ever the taunter, mocked the Drow with a staff. His magic caused the poison fog cloud to dissipate, revealing the enemies clearly. The sudden disappearance of the fog left their foes exposed and vulnerable.

------ 4/11 --------

Kalinar, with a burst of determination, launched magical blasts at the stone giant. However, one of his blasts misfired, and he fell unconscious, collapsing to the ground. Silvius, seeing the opportunity, tried to push the Drow but failed as Kazik, his loyal wolf companion, tried to move forward.

The stone giant retaliated by slamming ADC’s earth elemental with his massive club, causing the elemental to stagger. Meanwhile, a fire giant recklessly charged forward, swinging wildly but missing his mark and falling to the ground in his haste.

Oscorn, seeing his allies in need, used his divine powers to preserve life, partially healing the injured Czolg, Kalinar, and Fennuris. ADC, seizing the moment, waved his staff and conjured an ice storm over the four smaller fire giants and one of the Drow. The Drow succumbed to the chunks of ice and the bitter cold, collapsing lifelessly.

The earth elemental moved towards the fallen fire giant, delivering powerful blows while the giant lay on the ground. Czolg, fueled by rage, grew in size once more and charged into the fray with ferocity. Silvius, always quick with a sharp remark, mocked the stone giant, hurting and confusing him with his words.

Kazik, concerned for Kalinar, tried to nudge him awake. When nudging didn’t work, he bit Kalinar gently, waking him up. Kazik wagged his tail happily, looking like an excited puppy ready to play.

The stone giant, disoriented by Silvius' mockery, slung another boulder wildly, missing ADC by a wide margin. A smaller fire giant took advantage of the chaos and charged at Czolg, landing a solid hit. Another fire giant struck ADC’s earth elemental, further weakening it.

Undeterred, ADC swung his staff once more, creating a cone of powerful cold that blasted four fire giants and the stone giant. One of the fire giants was instantly frozen in place, turning to ice and shattering upon hitting the ground.

Czolg, fueled by his rage, struck down yet another fire giant with his spear, Panzerfaust. With a powerful thrust, he knocked another fire giant prone, asserting his dominance on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Fennuris, from her position, fired another volley of arrows. Her shots were true, hitting both the stone giant and one of the remaining fire giants.

Kalinar, seizing the moment, launched his magical attacks at the stone giant. One particularly devastating blast hit the giant square in the face, causing it to stagger in fear. Silvius, ever the master of taunts, mocked the stone giant again, further unsettling it. Meanwhile, Kazik, his loyal wolf companion, sniffed at the door in the middle of the hall, curious about what lay beyond.

The battle raged on as two fire giants surrounded Czolg, swinging their massive weapons at him. Czolg, though formidable, found himself in a fierce and exhausting struggle.

Suddenly, the team noticed the fog behind them beginning to disappear. From the dissipating mist emerged a cloud giant, who struck Fennuris hard in the back. She tried to run, but the cloud giant was relentless, striking her down and leaving her unconscious on the ground.

Seeing this, ADC cast telekinesis, holding one of the fire giants against the wall of force, immobilizing him. Silvius, witnessing Fennuris's plight, charged to her aid. He healed her with a few words, reviving her, and then turned his attention to the cloud giant. With Waythe, his magical greatsword, he delivered a powerful strike, knocking the cloud giant off his feet.

The fire giants, now wild with desperation, swung their weapons at Czolg again, but Czolg held his ground, ready to continue the fight alongside his comrades.

Oscorn, seeing the opportunity, cast a toll the dead spell on the cloud giant, hurting it further with necrotic energy. ADC maintained his telekinetic grip on the cloud giant, bolstered by the magical rune inscribed by Czolg. Czolg, ever the provocateur, insulted the fire giant, daring it to attack him again.

Kalinar seized the moment, finishing off the held cloud giant with a barrage of magical blasts, followed by a swift swipe from his conjured tentacle. The cloud giant collapsed, its enormous form crashing to the ground.

Silvius quickly revived Fennuris and, seeing that the cloud giant was no longer a threat, sprinted back across the hall towards the remaining fire giants. The team, feeling the toll of the battle, received a much-needed boost as Oscorn cast a powerful healing spell, rejuvenating everyone.

Fennuris, now back on her feet, rejoined the fray with a volley of arrows, striking the three fire giants. Silvius charged forward, landing a solid hit on one of the fire giants with Waythe before deftly stepping back out of the giant’s reach.

The battle continued to rage on as the fire giants surrounded Czolg, striking him from all sides with their massive weapons. Despite his resilience, the relentless assault took its toll.

On the opposite side of the hall, a fire giant attempted to climb over the wall of force. Silvius, thinking quickly, removed the wall, causing the giant to come crashing to the ground. In the chaos, the fire giant stood up and, in a tragic turn, killed Kazik, Silvius’s loyal wolf companion. Silvius, however, managed to land on his feet, ready to continue the fight.

ADC tried to telekinetically restrain the fire giant standing over Silvius but found himself outmatched. Frustrated, he called out, “How is he stronger than I am smart?!”

Czolg, undeterred by his wounds, lashed out with his spear, Panzerfaust, hitting the fire giants surrounding him and managing to kill one of them. Meanwhile, the gnolls were preparing their own attack.

Fennuris, ever the sharpshooter, unleashed a volley of arrows at the gnolls and fire giants, hitting many of them. In the midst of her assault, she lost her footing and fell to the ground, but her arrows still found their marks.

Kalinar sent magical blasts towards the fire giants, but in the chaos, his aim faltered, and he missed. Silvius, thinking quickly, created another wall of force, separating himself from the advancing fire giants and gnolls.

One of the fire giants, unaware of the newly erected wall, swung at Fennuris. His sword bounced back with a loud reverberation, causing him to stagger. Seizing the opportunity, Oscorn cast another healing spell, rejuvenating the injured members of the team.

ADC, seeing an opening, used his telekinesis to grab the Drow mage and pull him towards Czolg. Czolg, with a powerful strike, hit the Drow mage, causing the cloud of poison gas to disappear.

Fennuris, determined to keep fighting, lit her arrows on fire, preparing for her next assault. 

------ 4/20 ---------

Kalinar's tentacle lashed out with a massive attack, hitting a fire giant squarely. At the same time, Kalinar blasted the same fire giant with magic, further weakening it.

Silvius ran forward, his spirit guardians swirling around him, and killed a troll caught in their ethereal wrath. The nearby fire giant was visibly in pain from the spirit guardians' relentless assault.

Fennuris, her bow ablaze, fired flaming arrows at the cloud giant. Despite his struggles, the cloud giant failed to break free from ADC’s telekinetic grip. Oscorn, moving next to Czolg, cast Toll the Dead on the held cloud giant. Czolg, seizing the opportunity, released his headlock and began stabbing the cloud giant viciously with Panzerfaust, ultimately killing him.

Kalinar’s tentacle then attacked a nearby troll, while his magical blasts struck a fire giant. Silvius advanced, melting the troll on the ground with his spirit guardians. His guardians continued their onslaught, hitting the gnolls and the fire giant.

Fennuris aimed to shoot but got her bow stuck momentarily. Four gnoll arrows flew at Czolg and Fennuris but missed their marks. Oscorn attempted Toll the Dead again but missed. He then ran to the south side of the cave opening.

Czolg charged into the gnolls, stabbing them with Panzerfaust. Kalinar fired his magical blasts and struck down a gnoll with his tentacle. Silvius danced around the battlefield, striking at the ettin and two fire giants before retreating behind Czolg for cover.

The ettin attempted to charge past Czolg, but Czolg stopped him in his tracks, holding the line and protecting his comrades. 

Oscorn took a moment to scan the room, noting the many weapons and those in the process of being forged, all of them giant-sized. He focused his attention on the ettin, casting Toll the Dead to further weaken the creature.

Czolg took advantage of the moment, stabbing the ettin with Panzerfaust and delivering the killing blow. With the immediate threat neutralized, Czolg ran forward and checked the door, calling out, "Hi, anyone in there?" Hearing no response, he decided to shrink back to his normal size.

Turning to Silvius, Czolg reported, "They're all running away. There's a jail cell down there. We need to deal with one more to the north."

Fennuris, ever vigilant, held her arrow ready to fire at any new threat. Kalinar, despite his weariness, managed to shoot a magical blast, hitting his target but biting his tongue in the process.

All is quiet for a moment, the team catching their breath and assessing their surroundings. Suddenly, the heavy footsteps of a giant echo through the chamber. A stone giant emerges, carrying a bag of boulders, which he drops with a resounding thud. Another bag is hurled into the middle of the room, scattering its contents.

A fire giant, not far behind, picks up a rock and hurls it at Czolg. Oscorn, stepping forward, casts Toll the Dead at a nearby troll, while Czolg approaches the troll to engage. The troll charges, but Czolg stops it in its tracks. Fennuris, with deadly precision, finishes the troll off with a volley of arrows. Kalinar unleashes his magical blasts, aiming at the remaining giants.

The stone giant, seeing the assault, throws a rock that narrowly misses Oscorn. Another stone giant follows suit, this time hitting Oscorn squarely. Undeterred, Oscorn moves north along the ice wall, following Czolg. The fire giant and stone giant continue their barrage of rocks, their aim improving with each throw.

The team suddenly finds themselves stuck in the ice, the situation becoming increasingly dire. A quick debate ensues about whether to advance or retreat. Oscorn calls for a vote. "To the east it is," he declares.

Everyone starts running south, but Oscorn charges to the east, shouting, "There's at least three of them, guys!"

Fennuris, feeling the tension and determination, makes a brutal shot, taking down one of the gnolls. Silvius, focusing his magical energies, brings Kazik, the wolf, back to life with a few healing words. However, the respite is brief as the fire giant throws another rock, killing Kazik again.

Silvius, enraged, moves swiftly. His spirit guardians swirl around him, their ethereal forms slicing through the gnolls. The gnolls stop in their tracks, their silence confirming their demise as the spirit guardians claim them.

As the team pushes forward, Oscorn takes the lead, charging ahead and casting Hold Person to immobilize one of the fire giants. Meanwhile, the others keep moving, wary of the giants lurking in the north.

"Giants up north too," Czolg warns, his voice tense with anticipation. He approaches a door and calls out, "Is anyone in there?" but receives no response. Peering inside, he notices stairs leading downward.

Transforming into his larger form, Czolg alerts the team, "Cloud giant up north." Fennuris takes aim and fires at the fire giant, her arrows finding their mark.

Silvius, determined to protect his allies, resurrects Kazik and jumps on his back, charging forward into battle. With a fierce battle cry, he strikes at two fire giants, dealing them significant damage.

As the fire giants retaliate, one attempts to attack Czolg, while another targets Oscorn. Silvius, ever vigilant, distracts the giant attacking Oscorn, deflecting its blow.

Suddenly, a rat-like creature comes running in from the east. Oscorn reacts swiftly, hurling a bead of fireball that detonates with devastating effect, incinerating five of the rat people in a fiery blast.

Unfazed by the chaos, Czolg continues to press the attack, striking at the fire giant before moving to the center of the hall, ready to confront whatever challenges lie ahead.

----------- 4/27 --------------

As the chaos intensifies, Kalinar takes action, casting confusion to sow discord among their enemies. He summons his tentacle, but unfortunately, it misses its mark in the flurry of battle.

Silvius, recognizing the need for strategic positioning, conjures a wall of force, effectively blocking off the giants to the north and east, as well as the wererats attempting to flank them.

Despite Kalinar's efforts, the fire giant manages to break free from Oscorn's hold, regaining its freedom to wreak havoc. Undeterred, Oscorn channels divine energy, tolling the dead and weakening the fire giant in the south, while ADC repeats the process with the fire giant to the north.

Czolg seizes the opportunity to strike, landing a powerful blow on one of the giants, while the hill giant retaliates by attacking Kalinar.

Meanwhile, Fennuris, realizing the danger, disengages from the immediate threat and retreats to a safer distance. Kalinar continues to provide ranged support, shooting at the towering giants from a distance.

Kazik, ever loyal, sinks his teeth into the fire giant to the south, while Silvius swings Waythe, aiming to strike true but narrowly missing his target in the heat of battle.

As the giants attempt to retreat, the wall of force proves effective in impeding their escape. Oscorn, seizing the opportunity, strikes down the fire giant to the south with a decisive blow before making his way down the stairs to investigate further.

Meanwhile, the fire giant hurls wererats over the wall of force in a desperate attempt to eliminate the threat. Czolg, ever vigilant, intercepts and dispatches one of the rats, while another meets a swift end as it collides with the barrier.

The chaotic scene intensifies as the remaining rats scatter in panic. Ray, one of the fleeing creatures, meets his demise at the hands of Czolg, who swiftly ends its attempt to escape.

However, amidst the chaos, the cloud giant seizes the opportunity to snatch Fennuris with his telekinetic powers, lifting her off the ground. Oscorn, reacting quickly, lends his guidance to Fennuris, attempting to anchor her in place and prevent her from being carried away by the giant's grasp.

As the chaos unfolds, ADC swiftly dispatches the rat man next to him with a toll the dead spell, while Silvius continues to taunt the fire giant, goading it into dropping its sword and retreating.

ADC, keenly observant, notices a spell being cast by the cloud giant, prompting him to ready himself for what may come next. With a snap of the cloud giant's fingers, ADC retaliates in kind, prepared for any magical onslaught.

Meanwhile, Czolg takes advantage of the distraction and hurls a rock at the fire giant down the hall, landing a solid blow. Silvius, not one to miss an opportunity, continues his mockery of the cloud giant, further frustrating their formidable foe.

As the fog begins to envelop the area around ADC and Czolg, the team makes a swift decision to retreat to the torture room for safety. Oscorn, entering the room, quickly surveys their surroundings, while also casting light on a bone and tossing it down to illuminate the area as they descend further into the depths.

As Czolg cautiously opens the door to the west and finds it empty, Oscorn takes a moment to search the fallen Drow mages. Among their belongings, he discovers a staff adorned with a spider motif, spellcasting components, and a peculiar token inscribed with strange symbols.

Just then, a familiar voice echoes from the north—it's Ombi, the dwarf they've encountered before. His words urge them to leave, hinting at the dangers ahead. Meanwhile, Kalinar adjusts his tentacle, readying for whatever may come.

As Ombi calls out once more, ADC tenses, ready to dodge if necessary. Czolg, taking a healing potion, reassures Ombi they can hear him and encourages him to speak openly as he moves toward another door. Oscorn, feeling the weight of the situation, cautiously steps into Ombi's view.

"Are you the one that will speak to me?" Ombi questions, to which Oscorn responds by urging him to call off any threats. Ombi counters, mentioning the giants they've encountered, hinting at the potential consequences.

"What do you propose?" Oscorn inquires, seeking a resolution. Ombi, curious about their intentions, presses further, questioning their purpose in the warrens.

"We were attacked," Oscorn explains, attempting to justify their actions. Ombi remains skeptical, reminding them of the vast complexity of the situation.

"You're a jester," Oscorn accuses, but Ombi diverts attention, indicating his willingness to converse.

Stepping forward, Silvius confronts Ombi, questioning his motives in the warrens. Ombi asserts his claim to the place, prompting further inquiries from the team.

"How do we make your business our business? We pay handsomely," Czolg proposes, suggesting a potential alliance. Kalinar adds that cooperation could benefit both parties.

Silvius, with a touch of humor, remarks on the cleanliness of the floors amidst the mess of bodies and battle. The levity is interrupted by the reappearance of the tiger guy. Silvius reacts swiftly, casting a powerful spell of protection.

Meanwhile, ADC tolls the dead, unleashing his beholder's power, and Fennuris unleashes a volley of arrows. Kalinar, attempting to open another door, hears whispers from within and manages to pry it open.

Oscorn, with a solemn demeanor, invokes the power of death itself, casting toll the dead on the hill giant and dealing a devastating blow. Despite his injuries, the giant presses on, searching for Kalinar but unable to locate him amidst the chaos.

As the tension mounts, the Keeper, wielding his massive axe, charges into the fray, his presence striking fear into the hearts of the team. ADC, undeterred, continues to cast his spells, weakening the Keeper further with toll the dead and his beholder's relentless attacks.

Seeing the fire giant and the Keeper advancing, Silvius springs into action, running towards them with his spirit guardians swirling around him, striking both foes with righteous fury.

Sensing the impending danger, Fennuris casts pass without a trace, masking the team's presence and urging them to flee. With her voice ringing out in desperation, she implores her companions to run, to escape the clutches of their formidable adversaries.

As the situation grows increasingly dire, Kalinar raises the alarm, alerting his companions to the presence of two more giants to the south and two more closing in from behind. Oscorn, recognizing the urgency of the moment, calls out for someone to touch him, likely preparing for a powerful spell.

ADC, swift and decisive, unleashes his magical prowess, striking the fire giant to the south and providing sanctuary to Kalinar, offering him a brief respite from harm. Fennuris, ever the skilled archer, takes aim with her bow, releasing a volley of arrows aimed at the oncoming giants.

Oscorn attempts to cast a spell to magically restrain the fire giant to the south, but his efforts fall short, the magic fizzling before it can take hold. The enraged giant swings its sword at Fennuris, but she manages to evade the deadly blow, narrowly escaping harm.

In a desperate attempt to pull Fennuris to safety, ADC reaches out to drag her back, but his efforts are in vain as the fierce battle rages on around them.

Silvius, undaunted by the chaos, channels the power of his spirit guardians, striking the fire giant with divine fury before turning his attention to the looming threat of the Keeper. With a swift and decisive strike from Waythe, Silvius brings the Keeper down, ending his reign of terror.

Fennuris, her aim unwavering, continues to rain arrows upon the blinded fire giant, delivering the final blow that sends it crashing to the ground. Amidst the chaos, Kalinar calls out for Snure to join the fray, rallying their forces for the battle ahead.

But even as they celebrate their victory, another fire giant charges forward, its massive sword gleaming in the dim light as it strikes out at Czolg, dealing a devastating blow.

As Snure charges relentlessly at ADC and Oscorn from the south, the team braces for the impending clash. ADC swiftly reacts, conjuring a blast of icy cold from his staff. Despite the chilling onslaught, Snure shrugs off the freezing magic with a defiant growl.

With the giant bearing down on them, ADC deftly sidesteps, using misty steps to evade Snure's path of destruction. Silvius, undeterred by the looming threat, charges forward, weathering a blow from the fire giant as he reaches Snure. With a powerful swing of Waythe, Silvius strikes true, felling the giant king with a resounding blow.

Meanwhile, Kalinar channels dark magic, summoning a tentacle to ensnare Snure and drain the life from his massive form. As Czolg finishes off the fire giant to the north, he rushes to join the fray, his spear striking Snure repeatedly with deadly precision.

Oscorn, fueled by rage and determination, tolls the dead at Snure, his divine energy pulsing with vengeance. Snure, wounded and defiant, lashes out at Czolg with a powerful blow, taunting Oscorn with ominous words.

In a surge of fury, Oscorn swings his hammer at Snure, but his strike misses its mark. Unwavering, ADC channels his magic once more, unleashing another cone of cold that envelops Snure, freezing him solid in a prison of ice.

As Snure stands frozen in his icy tomb, Fennuris fires a final arrow, dispatching the fire giant to the north. With the threat momentarily neutralized, Czolg turns his attention to the retreating hill giant, who flees in terror at the sight of his fallen king.

Seizing the moment, Oscorn directs a divine strike at Snure's leg, shattering it with a burst of radiant energy. Determined to ensure Snure's defeat, Oscorn, with assistance from Silvius, retrieves the fallen king's crown, a symbol of their hard-won victory.

With the immediate danger passed, ADC conjures a protective hut, ushering the team inside and locking the door behind them. As they catch their breath within the safety of their makeshift shelter, the team reflects on their hard-fought triumph and the challenges that lie ahead in their perilous journey.
