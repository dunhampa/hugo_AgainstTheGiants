After emerging from Ombi the dwarf’s room, the team felt a renewed sense of purpose and energy. They had taken a much-needed rest, and now it was time to continue their exploration of the cavern.

Silvius and Kalinar moved toward the huts, opening the chests they found while Oscorn kept watch down the hall for any potential danger. In their search, they discovered two iron chests containing a significant haul:

900 gold pieces
A small satchel with 100 platinum pieces
A silver vase worth 500 gold pieces
A silver bowl worth 500 gold pieces
Kalinar swiftly placed all the treasure into his bag of holding, securing their newfound wealth. With their exploration yielding such valuable results, the team decided to take another long rest to prepare for whatever lay ahead.

During the rest, Kalinar’s eyes rolled back, and he moved around the room with a ghastly, ethereal gaze. Meanwhile, Silvius sent Kazik to scout ahead, and the quietness of the outside contrasted starkly with the room they had just left.

ADC, feeling antsy, remarked, “Where is my fey?”

Silvius, somewhat confused, replied, “It’s in the room.”

ADC, annoyed, clarified, “That’s a fairy, not a fey.”

Silvius, still puzzled, went back to checking more of the chests. Most contained items of a personal nature, but one locked chest held an assortment of wine and spirits. Kalinar, curious, decided to taste the wine to see if it was of any value.

Kalinar took a sip and immediately regretted it. The wine was absolutely disgusting, even by his standards. With a look of disgust, he threw the bottle down, and the shattering echo reverberated through the halls. The sound startled Oscorn, who immediately went on high alert.

Oscorn's keen eyes caught sight of part of a ballista down the hall. Realizing they might need some muscle, he motioned for Czolg to join him. Together, they moved cautiously toward the large weapon, ready for any surprises.

Back at the huts, Silvius and Kalinar continued their search, finding more gnoll-related items. Eventually, they stumbled upon a few more chests containing additional spirits and wine. Despite the foul taste, they decided to take a bottle each, thinking it might come in handy to throw on a fire if needed.

The team, invigorated by their recent discoveries, proceeded north down the hall. As they moved cautiously along the passage, they came upon a door on the east side. Fennuris, ever vigilant, found several large barrels of crude oil. Recognizing the potential utility of the oil, Oscorn came over to help Silvius investigate further.

Meanwhile, Czolg, ever practical, tipped over one of the barrels and began to roll it down the hall, just in case they needed to use it. As they continued their exploration, they discovered a burlap-wrapped bundle that glowed with a faint magical aura. Unwrapping it, they found a beautifully crafted longbow and 20 arrows, which Silvius promptly handed to Fennuris, knowing she would make the best use of them.

Czolg continued moving more barrels while Silvius opened a central door, revealing an old pen, now empty. Oscorn examined the room closely, even picking up and smelling some old dung. He deduced that animals had been there not too long ago.

ADC checked the longbow and arrows, confirming they were all +1 magical weapons. Oscorn then asked ADC to inspect a scroll they had found earlier.

As they ventured deeper into the area, they found what appeared to be a giant's bedroom. Inside, they opened a chest filled with typical giant-sized belongings. Nearby, they discovered a large kennel, which seemed to have been used recently.

Silvius continued his methodical search, finding a room hidden behind a tapestry. Within, he discovered a chest containing clothes, dried meat, and a bucket with a false bottom. Inside the hidden compartment were 20 platinum pieces, 8 gems, and 100 gold pieces.

Feeling a surge of inspiration, Silvius started to pray for a vision. His prayers were answered, revealing a glowing javelin among a pile of cloaks, throws, and furs. As he sifted through the pile, he found and retrieved a glowing sword and cloak.

ADC, intrigued by the dark cloak and shortsword they had found, sat down with them. Silvius addressed his intelligent, legendary sword, Waythe, asking, "If I were here before, there would be no giants left." Waythe's reply was as confident as ever, hinting at the sword's storied past.

ADC examined the cloak and determined it to be a Hellhound Cloak, which could be used to transform into a hellhound. He handed the +1 shortsword to Silvius and identified the javelin as a Javelin of Lightning.

As the team ventured further into the labyrinthine corridors, they entered another room where they were greeted by a human dressed in ordinary clothes but with strikingly bright blue eyes. He introduced himself as Aldon of Geoff.

Aldon explained his predicament to the team: "I was a scout, tasked with gathering information. Then I was captured, put in a sack, and taken through a portal. I felt time and space stretching around me, and when I emerged, I found myself here."

Kalinar shared his own experiences, describing the steading and the black ice they had encountered. Aldon shook his head, saying, "I don't remember those places. I was part of a previous spy group sent here on a mission."

Fennuris, ever the pragmatist, asked, "Why didn’t you open the doors or try to escape?"

Aldon replied, "I made it to the throne room but wasn't sure where else to go. The place is a maze, and danger lurks around every corner."

Their conversation was cut short as they focused on what lay ahead: a flaming sconce seeming to hover in the distance. As they moved closer, they realized the room was lit by several of these sconces and nicely decorated. 

They continued on until the found what looked to be a kitchen. As they entered the kitchen, they nearly stumbled into a chute covered in grease, leading to a long passageway below. From the heat emanating upwards, they guessed it to be a garbage chute.

ADC decided to send his fairy down the chute to investigate. The fairy descended, encountering increasing heat and a bright light at the bottom. It confirmed their suspicions: it was definitely a garbage chute.

After much deliberation, the team decided on a risky but potentially effective plan. They would try to sneak around the giants' prepared defenses and use the garbage chute to launch a surprise attack. Kalinar and Czolg would prepare to roll a barrel of crude oil down the main stairs as a distraction. Once the barrel was set in motion, Kalinar would join the rest of the team down the chute to ambush the giants.


"Kalinar, Czolg, get the barrel ready," Oscorn ordered. "Silvius, you'll go down the chute first. We'll lower you slowly."

Kalinar and Czolg nodded and headed off to retrieve the barrel, while Silvius approached the chute. He tied a sturdy rope around his waist, feeling the weight of the decision in his hands. With a deep breath, he began his descent, carefully navigating the turns in the slimy garbage chute.

The rope grew tighter as Silvius' weight increased, testing the strength of their makeshift plan. He could feel the garbage slime coating his hands as he held on, the unpleasant texture a constant reminder of the danger below. Above, Oscorn and Czolg were carefully lowering the rope.

As Silvius continued, Oscorn nearly lost his grip on the rope, but Czolg's quick reflexes saved it. Silvius sent a magical message to Oscorn, confirming he was still okay. "All good down here, keep it steady," his voice echoed in Oscorn's mind.

Czolg continued to lower the rope, his muscles straining with the effort. Suddenly, the knot holding Silvius began to come loose. Oscorn lunged to grab it, his heart pounding. He managed to catch the rope but couldn't maintain his hold as it slipped through his fingers.

Thinking quickly, Oscorn tried to shape the stone around the slipping rope with his magic. He missed. The rope slipped past, and Silvius plummeted down the chute.

Silvius felt the rush of air as he fell but invoked his magic, slowing his descent to the rate of a feather. As he emerged into the main room, he saw a pool of lava directly below. With a swift incantation, he created a magical Wall of Force, transforming his fall into a slide. The wall pushed a menacing troll, who had been waiting to ambush, into the pool of lava with a horrific screech.

Czolg was the first to leap down the chute after the falling rope, his massive form barreling through the narrow passage. Oscorn, quick to follow, jumped in right behind him. Kalinar hesitated for just a moment, casting a worried glance back up the chute before plunging in. ADC, taking a deep breath, finally followed suit.

Silvius, already at the bottom, was suddenly struck by a fire giant. "Help! Sliding down shit chute!" he yelled, trying to fend off the giant's attack.

One by one, the team slid down the chute. Silvius, seeing his friends coming down, cast Dimension Door and teleported back to the kitchen at the top of the chute. He quickly realized everyone was gone, so he jumped back down the chute to rejoin the fray.

As he re-entered the battle, the troll in the lava died with a final screech. Fennuris emerged from the chute and immediately fired his bow at the giants, his arrows finding their marks. Czolg, ready for action, grew in size and readied an attack.

Kalinar blasted the fire giant with a powerful spell, sending a shockwave through the room. Silvius summoned Kazik and quickly informed Oscorn, "I'm coming back down the chute!"

Czolg engaged a troll with his spear, pinning it in place. Oscorn, moving north, struck the troll and shouted, "One is held!"

With a mighty swing, Czolg landed a massive hit on the fire giant, followed by a critical strike with the back of his spear. ADC, casting a flame bolt, hit the held fire giant, adding to the onslaught.

Silvius slid down and ignited his flame shortsword, striking the troll. Kalinar dashed forward, blasting the troll again. The troll, struggling to stand, swiped at Oscorn with its claws, but Oscorn retaliated with a divine strike.

Fennuris, aiming true, shot the troll and killed it. Suddenly, a gnoll appeared and threw a spear, narrowly missing Silvius. More gnolls emerged, drawing their bows.

Czolg, unstoppable, ran forward and killed the spear-throwing gnoll with a powerful hit. He then turned his attention to the next gnoll. ADC, observing the chaos, asked, "Can we wait for them to come here?"

But Silvius, already in motion, ran at the gnolls and cast Spirit Guardians, summoning spectral protectors to aid in the battle. Kalinar, not missing a beat, unleashed another blast, targeting the remaining enemies.
