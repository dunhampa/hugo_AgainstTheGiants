WIP DRAFT

With Czolg firmly maintaining his hold on the captured Drow mage, the rest of the party approaches cautiously, their eyes scanning the surroundings for any potential threats. Oscorn, ever watchful, positions himself at the rear, ensuring they are not caught off guard from behind.

Kalinar takes the opportunity to engage the Drow mage in conversation and mock them in their loss "Your friends seemed eager to escape. What's the rush?" he asks, hoping to elicit a response.

In a defeated and sullen tone, the Drow mage responds in Undercommon, a language unfamiliar to the team, rendering their efforts at understanding futile. Sensing the confusion and a window of opportunity to flee, the Drow glances around, a puff of mist enveloping her before she vanishes from the teams' sight.

ADC's pocket fairy companion, ever vigilant, catches a glimpse of another Drow materializing and disappearing in rapid succession. Oscorn, keeping a keen eye on the surroundings, notices a lever pushed upwards, seemingly controlling the door that the Drow burst through earlier. It becomes evident that the door can only be opened from one side.

There is another door to the far east of the next room, which appears to be a prison cell. Kalinar attempts to force it open, but his efforts prove fruitless as it remains firmly secured from the other side. Searching the bodies of the fallen Drow, the team discovers several Drow shortswords and long dark staffs with a spider design on top. Additionally, they uncover three medallions and a brooch, intriguing artifacts that may hold further significance in their quest.

As the team takes a longer look in the second room, they are struck by its opulence and grandeur, far surpassing the previous chamber. The dark tapestries and floor coverings have been replaced with exquisite furnishings, including ornate cabinets, a lavish bed, elegant tables, sturdy coffers, a grand wardrobe, and several diwans.

Sensing the significance of this room, Silvius decides to ask Ilmater for guidence on if there is magic in the area, hoping to uncover any hidden enchantments or mystical energies. His spell reveals intriguing findings—a coffer positioned near the bed emanates a gentle glow from within, while another coffer situated between two diwans pulses with evocation magic, indicating it might be a trap. 

Exercising caution, Silvius and Kalinar carefully inspect the area around the seemingly safer coffer near the bed, diligently searching for any signs of traps. To their relief, they find no immediate indications of danger. Encouraged by their assessment, Silvius approaches the coffer and cautiously opens it.

Inside, they discover six potions, intriguingly distinct from conventional glass bottles. These vessels are instead intricately carved from stone, adorned with peculiar writings that appear unfamiliar to the team. The contents and properties of the potions remain unknown, leaving them with a sense of intrigue and curiosity.

Silvius carefully hands the stone-carved potions to ADC, knowing only ADC can take on the task of identifying their properties. ADC, utilizing his knowledge and expertise, examines each potion and then distributes them among the team.

He keeps the Potion of Poison for himself, recognizing its potential usefulness. The Potion of Mind Control, specifically tailored for influencing fire giants, is handed to Silvius, given his proficiency in magic and manipulation. Oscorn is entrusted with the Potion of Growth, a concoction that could enhance his already formidable ability to ho-door. Czolg receives the Potion of Heroism, a fitting tool to extend his bravery and prowess in battle. Lastly, Silvius receives both Filters of Love, perhaps with a hint of amusement in the allocation.

With the potions allocated, Silvius proposes a cautious approach to the magic coffer, recognizing its potential as a trap. He suggests thoroughly searching the room before proceeding further. The team collectively scours the chamber, scrutinizing every nook and cranny for any additional clues or hidden dangers.

In the midst of their search, Silvius stumbles upon a mysterious map, adorned with writings similar to those found on the stone potion vials. The discovery sparks intrigue and speculation, hinting at a possible deep connection between the map and the potions. 

As the team continues their thorough search of the room, it becomes evident that it once served as the abode of a high-ranking female figure. The surroundings exude an air of elegance and prestige. Among their findings, they uncover:

- A screen adorned with intricate amber inlays, a testament to the craftsmanship of its construction.
- A magnificent dress displayed on a mannequin, adorned with numerous jewels. Recognizing the value of the gemstones, the team carefully removes them from the dress and stores them away for safekeeping. The gems consist of 10 amethysts (100 gp each), 10 black opals (10 gp each), a topaz (50 gp), and 10 violet garnets (50 gp each). Oscorn takes charge of safeguarding these valuable gemstones in his bag.
- A goblet crafted from lapis lazuli, a prized possession worth an estimated 500 gp. Oscorn stows the goblet away in his bag, ensuring its protection.
- A large mirror, which reflects the team's collective gaze as they inspect their surroundings.
- Two combs, a brush, four hairpins, and ten jars containing cosmetics. These items are intricately crafted from silver and onyx, each inlaid with gems valued at 50 gp each. Silvius takes an interest in the makeup contained within the jars, carefully removing them for personal use, while Oscorn stores the remaining items in his bag.

In addition to the newfound treasures, the team also discovers more medallions and brooches, one on each of the fallen Drow. These insignias, perhaps denoting rank or allegiance, serve as further evidence of the significance of the adversaries they have encountered.

Heeding Silvius' instruction, the team retreats from the room, giving him space to deal with the trapped coffer using his mage hand. However, before Silvius can proceed, ADC interrupts him with a sense of urgency and annoyance in his voice. "Wait, wait, wait," ADC interjects, asserting that a more cautious approach is required when dealing with a magical trap.

ADC approaches the coffer and runs his hand over its surface, carefully sensing for any magical glyphs or triggers. As his hand glides over the coffer, a glyph briefly glows brightly but then fades away harmlessly. The team collectively breathes a sigh of relief, grateful for ADC's intervention.

Expressing his gratitude, Silvius proceeds to open the coffer, revealing three scrolls within protective sleeves. Silvius identifies the contents of each scroll:

- The first scroll, written in Elvish, is a Scroll of Greater Restoration. Recognizing its potential value, Silvius hands it to Oscorn, knowing that his divine abilities as a cleric of life will enable him to effectively utilize the scroll's restorative properties to aid their wounded allies.
- The second scroll is a Scroll of Divine Word, a potent spell that Silvius tucks away for future use.
- The third scroll, enclosed in an especially ornate sleeve, contains a truly powerful spell—Gate. Recognizing the immense power and significance of this spell, Silvius carefully hands it over to ADC, acknowledging his proficiency in magic.

In addition to the scrolls, the team also discovers several glowing rods, each adorned with three flowing tentacles at their tops. Recognizing their potential as formidable weapons, Kalinar, ADC, and Oscorn claim one rod each, each member wielding a tentacle rod for their use.

Acknowledging the need to tend to their wounds and recuperate, the team takes the opportunity to bandage their injuries and rest for an hour, allowing for a much-needed short rest to restore their strength and vitality.

After realizing the door to the east is locked from the other side, preventing their progress, Kalinar informs the team of their predicament. Recognizing the need to retrace their steps, the team decides to head back west along the path they came, pulling the lever Oscorn had discovered and proceeding northward.

As they continue their journey, the team notices a series of prison cells lining the corridor. Approaching the first prison door to the north, Fennuris takes the initiative, climbing on Czolg's back to reach the sliding window located 12 feet above the ground on the door. Peering through the window, Fennuris catches a glimpse of a shadowy figure inside the cell, hearing the faint sound of Elvish but unable to comprehend the words.

Curiosity piqued, Oscorn requests a turn to observe the figure. Czolg suggests, "Maybe someone not so heavy," prompting Silvius to climb up instead and gaze through the bars. Silvius spots the face of a dark-skinned female leaning forward, her expression filled with a mixture of surprise and confusion.

Silvius initiates the conversation, saying, "Hello." The shadowy figure responds with disbelief, "Am I hallucinating? A human and then an elf?" Silvius reassures her, "No, not at all. We're here." Curiosity fills the figure's voice as she asks, "How are you here? The hallways were infested with giants." Silvius casually replies, "Well, it's now more... littered with giants," gesturing towards the aftermath of the battle behind him.

Introducing herself as Anna, the figure explains that she ventured to speak with the "cold ones" on behalf of her people, hoping to address the havoc they had been wreaking upon her land. However, her efforts proved futile, leading her to this imprisonment. Anna expresses her fear that she may be a victim of some sort of ritual or sacrifice, questioning why she is being held captive.

Silvius, intrigued by her story, asks, "Who are your people?" Anna responds, her voice tinged with sorrow, "I come from the Blackmore, in the black ice. Many of us snow elves live there."

As Silvius converses with Anna, Fennuris, ever observant, leans towards Silvius and whispers, "Does she have a ring?" Silvius smirks mischievously and replies, "I didn't look for one yet. Maybe we'll get there eventually," winking playfully at Fennuris. She rolls her eyes and lets out a slight sigh of disgust, clearly unimpressed with Silvius' flirtatious nature. 

Silvius inquires, "Did you come through the portal of Jarl?" Anna's response carries a sense of weariness as she shares, "Jarl never bothered us. We simply tried to separate from him. He had other plans for our people. I haven't spoken to anyone without the red face or dark complexions for a long time. If you help me, I know my people will pay you handsomely. I just need to get out of here."

Silvius confidently declares, "Well, the Jarl is no more," as he reaches down and retrieves Jarl's pipe that was strapped to Czolg's back. Anna seems unimpressed and remarks, "You just took his pipe. You didn't defeat the Jarl." However, as Anna steps forward, Silvius observes her striking features. She is surprisingly tall and remarkably thin, standing at 6'3" with tan skin, white-blonde hair, and silvery eyes. Her clothing, once bright white, is now tattered and dirtied.

Silvius reassures her, saying, "We did defeat him, and we also got here to you. Let's get you out of here." Silvius attempts to pick the lock, but his efforts prove futile. Oscorn steps in and uses his stone-shaping abilities to create a hole in the stone wall, providing an alternate escape route for Anna. Grateful for the newfound light and the sight of different faces, Anna crawls through the opening, expressing her gratitude.

However, Oscorn reminds the team of their other pressing responsibilities. Anna understands their urgency and acknowledges, "I need to try to make my escape." Oscorn emphasizes their mission, stating, "We have things to do. We must deal with the drow for our own reasons." Anna's face falls and is concerned when she hears the word drow, but she quickly agrees to help in any way she can, including sending goods to assist them. She expresses her concern upon learning of the drow's presence, stating that they are familiar with the drow but have never interacted with them. Anna promises to speak with her leaders about the team and their cause, hoping to garner support from her people.

Oscorn informs Anna about their conquests and their current march on Grugnore, the Jarl's stronghold. He urges her to relay their names and their quest to her leaders, assuring her that they will mention her and her people to their patrons. Anna contemplates their encounter, remarking, "The entrance to the Drow has never been found. Maybe this is why. Who ventures into a place like this?" In response, the entire team raises their hands.

Anna reflects on the enigmatic nature of the drow, stating, "It kind of makes sense now. Nobody knows where they come from, nobody knows where they hail. Maybe the answer lies within." Oscorn seizes the opportunity to inquire about the flying tiger they encountered, but Anna confesses that she has never seen such a creature. When asked about her duration of captivity, Anna admits uncertainty, but urges caution in the team's pursuit of the drow, as their path may hold unknown dangers.

Oscorn seeks any advice Anna can offer regarding the drow, but she confesses that even her people have limited knowledge of their true nature. The team's presence and exploration may shed light on the mysterious and despised drow, potentially making them the discoverers of their true identity. Silvius provides Anna with directions to leave via the path the team initially entered through, allowing her to make her swift departure.

Anna bids the team farewell, expressing her gratitude once again, and disappears into the darkness.

Fennuris climbs onto Czolg's back and peers into the next prison cell, she is greeted with the sight of eight elves. Upon Fennuris' discovery of the elves inside the next prison cell, she quickly relays the information to the team, prompting Kalinar to swiftly pick the lock. With the door now unlocked, Czolg pulls it open, revealing the group of wood elves within. Their eyes widen in surprise and anticipation, unsure of the newcomers' intentions.

One of the elves cautiously steps forward, eyeing the team with suspicion. "You, you're not giants. What do you want?" they inquire. Silvius steps forward and replies, "We're here to rid this place of giants and protect our lands."

The same elf's confusion deepens as they ask, "Are you kidding me? What's going on here? Are there more giants nearby?" Silvius responds with reassurance, saying, "There are more giants, but there are fewer now. We have been fighting to push them back."

The elf's eyes widen with a glimmer of hope, exclaiming, "We can be free, we can leave! We will sing your praises!" Silvius, his excitement palpable, exclaims, "Literally?! We have lyrics!" as he excitedly grabs his book of lore.

The elf, still skeptical but intrigued, remarks, "You seem strangely well-prepared for this. But yes, we will sing your praises! What is your name?" Silvius grins and proudly announces, "We are Operation Trundle Wagon." The newly freed elves begin to sing...

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "right"  Caption = "The eight rescued elves sing praises of Operation Trundle Wagon" imagePath = "/img/AtG Chp 3 OTW Song.JPG"  width = "60%" >}}

After the elves finish their heartfelt song, their voices harmonizing with gratitude and newfound hope, they make a collective decision to flee. Sensing the urgency of their departure, Oscorn steps forward and offers each elf 50 gold pieces to assist them on their journey to a brighter future. The elves gratefully accept the gold, their eyes filled with appreciation as they shake hands with Oscorn and the rest of the team.

Before parting ways, Oscorn shares the name of his temple, the Temple of Light in Enstad. He encourages the elves to include the name in their songs, knowing that congregations like the Temple of Light will be remembered for their acts of kindness and compassion. The elves nod, understanding the significance of spreading the word about the Temple and the Operation Trundle Wagon. One of the elves speaks up, their voice brimming with sincerity, "Congregations like the Temple will be remembered for their kindness. And your group, the Operation Trundle Wagon, will never be denied."

ADD PICTURE WITH ODE OF OSCORN

The team proceeds to the next locked prison cell door. Kalinar skillfully picks the lock, and as the door swings open, he calls out, "Hello, is somebody in there?"

Inside the cell, they find a hunched figure, seemingly human. The person looks up and responds in common, "Down here? You still have all your things. What are you doing here? How do you have your things?"

Czolg bluntly replies, "We take their things," referring to the giants they have encountered along their journey. The hunched figure, introducing themselves as Billy, steps forward from the corner of the cell, a mixture of confusion and hope in their eyes. "I haven't been here long. I'm Billy. I don't know how this place works."

Kalinar, noticing a resemblance to the previously freed prisoners, remarks, "You kind of look like the others we let out earlier." Silvius interjects, "But he doesn't sound like a pack of singing elves to me."

Billy expresses their desire to leave, echoing the sentiment of freedom shared by the others. Kalinar continues to pick the lock with a little assistance from Silvius and Oscorn, all while asking Billy, "You didn't come with anybody else?"

Billy replies, "Things get taken, thrown in a bag, end up here where it's hot. I don't know what happened. I understand I was farther away than I should have been."

With the door now unlocked, Billy starts walking toward the team, their weariness evident. Kalinar explains, "We're here to free our lands from the giants and the drow. Do you know anything about them that could help us?"

In a hopeful yet practical tone, Billy asks, "Do you need help selling things?" Silvius chuckles and responds, "Hopefully someday."

Billy nods and promises, "If I make it back to Goth, I will help you." Silvius then provides directions on how to leave the fortress safely.

Grateful for the team's assistance, Billy, the human, follows the same path as the previously freed captives.

The team's gaze shifts to two more prison cells, one to the west and another to the east. Realizing that the western cell lacks a window, they decide to focus their attention on the eastern one. Kalinar climbs onto Czolg's back, attempting to get a glimpse inside, but the absence of a window once again obstructs their view.

Sensing the need for more information, Silvius turns to Waythe and asks for a reconnaissance of the area. Waythe swiftly scouts ahead and relays the information back to Silvius. "Enemies are to the southeast, not towards the door," Waythe reports.

With this knowledge in mind, the team swiftly pops the chains and unlocks the door to the east. Czolg forcefully swings it open, revealing two figures with horse bottoms and humanoid tops — centaurs. Surprised to see more light than they have likely witnessed in days, the centaurs blink in astonishment.

The centaurs ask, "Do you need help?" Czolg interjects with a touch of sarcasm, "We would take some help; you look like you needed some too."

The centaurs, appreciating the honesty, respond, "Everyone can use help here. We are willing to join up if it means getting out of here." Czolg inquires about their presence, asking, "How did you end up here?"

One of the centaurs, named Vrol, recounts their harrowing tale. "They raided our towns and slaughtered us. We managed to take some of them out, but we are unsure why they spared us."

Oscorn, empathizing with their plight, shares a brief summary of their own journey that led them to this fortress. Silvius, eager to inspire the centaurs, opens his book and points out moments of specific glory, highlighting the team's accomplishments.

Curious about the centaurs' origin, Oscorn asks, "How did you two end up here?"

Vrol responds, "Our clan hails from the Whispering Woods, north of Goth, in the Dim Forest. I am Vrol," he gestures to himself, "and this is Kiros," indicating the other centaur.

Silvius seizes the opportunity to inquire about the drow. Vrol admits, "We have heard of them but haven't encountered them personally."

Silvius makes a proposition, "Will you help us with the giants and drow?" Vrol considers the offer carefully before replying, "Our best chance of survival is with all of you. We don't have any of our weapons or belongings anymore. We are skilled with weapons such as pikes and longbows."

After a brief discussion, the team decides to equip the centaurs with suitable weapons. They hand over the fine magical Battleaxe taken from Ombi's room to Vrol and Fennuris's old longbow to Kiros, ensuring they have the means to fight alongside the team.

What is inside the remaining prison cells? What lies in the other areas of Snure's volcano? What lies below?
