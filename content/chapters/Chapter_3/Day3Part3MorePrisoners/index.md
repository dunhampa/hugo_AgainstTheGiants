OTW stood before a set of imposing prison cells, each holding secrets and potential dangers within. Despite the temptation to immediately open the cells, Kalinar decided to hold off, at least for now. He knew that caution and careful planning were crucial when dealing with the unknown.

As Kalinar's eyes rolled back, an eerie sight befell him. His eyes turned pitch black, and he seemed to gaze beyond the physical realm, peering through the very walls of the prison. With his ghostly stare, he observed the contents of each cell without having to open them.

To the northwest, he laid eyes on a creature of immense size and power - a titan, the stuff of legends. It was a creature he had only heard of in ancient stories and never dreamed of encountering in reality.

Turning his attention to the far east, Kalinar spotted a female humanoid figure, sadly bound and chained to the wall. Her presence raised questions about who she was, why she was imprisoned, and whether she posed a threat or a potential ally.

Another cell held a grim scene - two humanoid skeletons lying lifeless on the cold stone floor. Their presence told a tale of sorrow and struggle, and Kalinar wondered what tragic fate had befallen them.

In another  cell, a fire giant was confined, held captive by unknown forces. Its presence was a clear indication that the dangers within these walls were not to be taken lightly.

As Kalinar continued to peer through the walls, his attention was drawn to something even more concerning. In the far north-eastern corner, near a set of stairs leading down, he glimpsed what appeared to be more fire giants - possibly guardians of this ancient place, waiting to be unleashed upon intruders.

Having seen enough, Kalinar shared his findings with his team. With careful consideration, he suggested opening the cells containing the titan and the female humanoid..

Silvius and Kalinar found themselves facing a massive prison cell, its iron bars enclosing a colossal blue giant. Unconscious and bound in heavy chains, the titan was a formidable sight to behold. The adventurers decided to free him from his captivity.

Czolg nudged the titan gently, hoping to awaken him. Silvius looked to Oscorn, the life cleric, seeking his insight, "What's wrong with him, Oscorn?"

Oscorn examined the titan closely, recognizing the symptoms, "He's been exposed to oil of tagit, a potent sleep-inducing substance."

With his skilled hands, Oscorn cast a spell of restoration and healing on the titan's hand, attempting to counteract the effects of the poison. Slowly, the titan began to stir, his eyes blinking open as he observed Silvius, Kalinar, Czolg, and Oscorn standing before him.

"You seem to be out of place," the titan remarked, his voice deep and resonant.

Czolg couldn't resist adding a touch of humor, "Nice chains you got there."

Unfazed, the titan replied, "I do seem to find myself in a predicament."

Kalinar chimed in playfully, "A conundrum if you will."

Czolg grinned, gesturing to Oscorn, "You were poisoned, but Oscorn here fixes that stuff like no other."

Curious, the titan turned to Oscorn, "Why are you here?"

"We're working through the giants here. We are seeking the Drow and a fire wyrm," Oscorn explained.

The titan revealed his purpose, "Drow is why I come."

Silvius inquired further, "Why the Drow? What's at stake?"

The titan's expression turned serious, "There is a natural order, and the Drow are upsetting that balance. I came to reason with them, but apparently, I was drugged to prevent it."

Oscorn saw an opportunity for cooperation, "We could help each other. Giants and Drow are tough adversaries, but there's also the wyrm to contend with."

The titan's eyes widened slightly, "There is nothing I fear here more than the red wyrm."

Oscorn replied, "So, it's truly a dragon."

Kalinar couldn't help but exclaim, "This wyrm's got wings!"

The titan confirmed their fears, "The giants feed its hoard for the Drow. This alliance goes against the natural order and must be stopped."

Kalinar spoke with determination, "With us together, they should be the ones scared."

The titan held up his chains, seeking their aid, "May I have some help with these?"

Silvius wasted no time and began to remove the chains from the titan, setting him free.

As the titan stood tall and liberated, he looked at the assembled group, "My name is Zeke. I am known as one of the children of the gods from the upper planes. The Drow's actions threaten the balance, and I came to reason with them. But it seems they chose to imprison me instead.The Drow seem to see the time of war and turmoil for those above as an opportunity to strike while the iron's hot, if you will."

Kalinar, helping him with the remaining chains, asked eagerly, "Have you spoken to Ecvaldra?"

Zeke shook his head, "No, only giants."

Silvius inquired, "Do you know of any other place the Drow have taken hold of?"

Zeke's expression turned solemn, "I do not know the underdark. Nobody does but them. It's a twisted maze nobody else seems to make it through."

Czolg, always practical, asked the important question, "How do you kill them?"

"They are weak to light, and females are often in charge," Zeke replied with a sense of determination.

Now free from his confinement, Zeke stood tall and stretched out, his impressive form towering over the group. He was as large as a fire giant, but his appearance held a more human-like aspect than any of the giant operations trundle wagon had encountered before.

Czolg offered, "Need weapons? There are plenty about."

Zeke nodded in gratitude, "I came with my maul. Not sure what they did with it."

As they made their way out of the cell, following Silvius, Kalinar, Czolg, and Oscorn, Zeke's eyes fell upon Fennuris, ADC, and the centaurs who had been waiting outside. He greeted them warmly, "Why hello. And what are your names?"

Fennuris, being the charismatic leader, stepped forward, "I am Fennuris, and this is my faithful companion ADC, and these are our centaur friends."

The centaurs nodded respectfully, and ADC offered a light bow as they gave their names in turn.

Silvius and Kalinar approached the next massive prison cell. The clanking of chains echoed through the chamber as they worked together to pick the lock, finally opening the cell door. Before them, they found a female humanoid, chained to the wall.

As they entered the cell, the female humanoid looked up, surprised to see visitors. "You aren't what one would expect to see here. Giants tend to get grabby and lock anyone they find away. I'm looking for Snure's treasure," she said excitedly.

Kalinar, always curious, started helping her with the chains. "Have you found it?"

"Well, the name is Sarafin. I know it's on the upper floor somewhere. That's where Snure keeps all the gems and treasure he keeps for himself," Sarafin replied with a sparkle in her eyes.

Czolg, overhearing the conversation, couldn't help but join in, "How'd you get in here?"

Sarafin's enthusiasm didn't wane as she answered, "I came by a giant bag, like most of us here, I'd imagine."

Kalinar, always one to gather information, continued, "How did you get caught?"

"That flying cat found me. He's a tricky one," Sarafin sighed, recalling the encounter.

Curious about her story, Kalinar probed further, "You're one of the first people we've seen here…"

Sarafin nodded, seemingly unfazed, "Yes, I don't know why they kept me alive either."

Czolg chimed in, curious about the rumored treasure within the ruins, "We've heard there's great treasure in this place."

Sarafin's eyes lit up at the mention of treasure, "Oh, you have no idea! The stories are true!"

Satisfied with their newfound potential ally, Silvius and Kalinar introduced themselves, "I am Silvius, and this is Kalinar. We are adventurers seeking to put an end to the Drow's malevolent plans and stop the red wyrm."

With her enthusiasm for treasure and the promise of adventure ahead, Sarafin eagerly responded, "I'm Sarafin, and I have a feeling that with your help, I'll find Snure's treasure in no time!"

As the trio made their way out of the cell, Zeke, now freed, stood tall, observing the exchange. Sarafin's eyes widened in amazement as she caught sight of the massive titan. "Wow! A giant!" she exclaimed, seemingly in awe of Zeke's imposing presence.

Zeke acknowledged her with a nod, "I am Zeke."

Sarafin nodded, still starstruck by the sight of the titan. "Yes, that's right! I can't believe I'm standing before a real giant!"

Zeke chuckled warmly, "Well, you have an impressive spirit yourself, Sarafin."

Silvius and Kalinar approached the next massive prison cell containing the fire giant. The clanking of chains echoed through the chamber as they worked together to pick the lock, finally opening the cell door. Before them, they found the fire giant, towering and intimidating, confined within the cell.

As they entered the cell cautiously, the fire giant looked at them with a mix of surprise and suspicion. "Who are you, and what do you want?" he asked, his deep voice resonating in the confined space.

Kalinar stepped forward, trying to remain composed despite the giant's imposing presence. "We seek to confront Snure and put an end to the Drow's nefarious plans. Do you know anything about the lower levels or the location of Snure's treasure above?"

The fire giant introduced himself, "I am Baldo, chief lieutenant of Snure. And I know nothing of what lies below or the exact whereabouts of Snure's treasure above."

Silvius and the team exchanged glances, realizing that they had encountered a significant figure among Snure's forces. Their options on what do to with Baldo were limited. Killing Baldo, a captive of the fire giants, felt wrong although he was a fire giant and couldn’t truly be trusted. However, leaving him behind posed its own risks.

ADC stepped forward, a glimmer of an idea in mind. Casting a long and potent spell, ADC invoked a geas on Baldo, commanding him, "You must safely guide us wherever we need to go."

The words of the geas took hold in Baldo's mind, and he felt compelled to obey. The fire giant's expression changed, and he looked more relaxed, almost as if a heavy burden had been lifted from his shoulders.

Baldo nodded, acknowledging his newfound purpose, "Very well. I shall guide you as you wish."

With Baldo now under the influence of the geas, the team felt a sense of relief. They had found a way to ensure his cooperation without resorting to violence.

After some talk of treasure and other potential loot upstairs, OTR decides to head below and continue their journey to what they came for. The team opens the large doors that lead to the downward stairs. ADC locks the door with their special word behind them.

They slowly walked down the stairs and through a long hallway. It looks different than anything they had seen before in this place. It's much more of a cave. No polished stone walls or floors, but instead rough cavern walls, and they can hear water dripping and the distant echo of stone strikes.

As OTR continues their walk down the hall, they see a pool of water to the south and slime on the ground. Kalinar walks up to explore the slime, and suddenly, it lunges at him. With quick reflexes, Kalinar dodges to the side.

Silvius, never one to miss an opportunity for humor, mockingly comments on the attacking slime. "Well, aren't you feisty!" and the slime recoiled from a slight pinch of pain from his words.

The slime then puffs itself up larger, and to the team's surprise, more oozes drop from the ceiling, surrounding them. One of the oozes manages to hit Oscorn, but his magical chain mail prevents it from causing any damage.

Czolg takes immediate action, swiftly striking down one slime with Panzerfaust, and then another with a decisive swing. He runs forward towards Kalinar, ready to provide support.

Kalinar deftly dodges back and retaliates with a fury of magical blasts, taking out the slime that attacked him.

ADC uses their spellcasting abilities to toll the dead, dealing a powerful blow to the slime in front of Czolg.

Fennuris, relying on her bow and arrows, shoots at another slime. However, her arrows dissolve away in the acidic creature after the strikes.

Another ooze manages to hit Oscorn, but Oscorn retaliates, smashing it back and destroying it with his hammer.

Czolg finishes off the final ooze, pinning it to the wall as it falls into a dead pool on the ground, bubbling away.

Silvius, decides to be more cautions, pulls out Waythe and asks if there are any more enemies nearby. Waythe doesn't sense any, and the team continues on.

They continue to the east past the pool. As Kalinar rounds a corner, he spots a gigantic red dragon in the middle of the room, atop a massive pile of gold and treasure.

The team freezes, their hearts pounding in their chests. The dragon hasn't noticed them yet, and they take a moment to assess the situation. They must decide how to proceed, for the dragon's presence poses a formidable challenge and a potential threat to their mission.
