The team left Brazemel's lair with a mix of shame and sorrow, having retreated without their hard-earned items and treasures, yet grateful to live another day. Among them, Oscorn wore the brightest smile as he clutched his tiara, a relic from his homeland, with stunning beauty and the incredible power to understand and speak with all creatures.
Expressing his gratitude, Oscorn walked around, thanking each party member for their help in recovering his precious relic. The air was thick with relief and camaraderie as they made their way back from the cave. Silvius, however, had questions burning in his mind and turned to Zeke.
"Did you know what was in there?" Silvius inquired.
Zeke, seemingly surprised, responded, "I didn't know. Who was there?"
"A real and powerful red dragon," Silvius answered solemnly.
"Brazemel?" Zeke's expression shifted to a mix of surprise and nervousness. "What was he doing there?"
"I didn't know that was one of his entrances. He's an ancient dragon," Silvius explained. "We keep tabs on his comings and goings. This one is news to me," Zeke admitted.
Kalinar interjected, "Can you detect these portals he uses?"
Zeke sighed, "Not me personally, but we try to keep tabs on their movements. My people and I can move from plane to plane, but only once a day, and I have business here."
Silvius speculated, "Could Brazemel be the cause of this?"
Zeke shook his head, "Not on his own. He must be connected to a race or another group. This is an odd place for him. This mountain has many twists and turns that are very odd. The Drow must have been a part of this."
Silvius agreed, "Maybe this could be a clue. Can you read it?"
Zeke took a long look at the map and responded, "It does seem like something from the Drow. Actually, it's a map. It is in a weird dialect, though."
Silvius eagerly asked, "What does it say?"
Zeke pointed at each location on the map and shared his understanding. "On the top, it reads 'Vault, Drow.' The two dots represent 'Black Guardians.' The third says something like 'Vault and Drow, maybe Gate?' The fourth mentions a shrine and another word that sounds like 'Kua toa.' Those are rarely seen, and even more rarely, if not never, in the Underdark. They tend to worship large gods. The fifth talks of a barge crossing, and the map looks like a river. The sixth says 'caverns and warrens.' Seven is a spy post. The final set of symbols says 'checkpoint.' After that... who knows."
Silvius thanked Zeke, and with a determined gaze, he continued to study the map. Zeke chimed in, "I hope that helped."
