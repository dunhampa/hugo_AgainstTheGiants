The team is in the midst of battle deep within the Snure's volcano. Silvius leads the charge, calling upon the spirits of Waythe and Ilmater for protection. He strikes the fire giant, then retreats behind Czolg, who stabs the same fire giant with Panzerfaust.

Meanwhile, Oscorn keeps watch to the southwest, where he spots a cooking fire but doesn't detect any additional creatures. He then sees the fire giants advance from the south, approaching Kalinar, Fennuris, and ADC.

At the same moment, three fire giants burst through the door next to Silvius. One hits him hard with his sword, while the second misses with a massive axe and falls to the ground. ADC creates a wall of ice, pushing the fire giant who hit Silvius further out into the hallway and injuring the fire giant with the axe.

Fennuris and Kalinar attack the southern fire giant with arrows and blasts, while Silvius tries to reach his friends through a gap in the wall, but the gap in the ice is too small for him to pass through. The fire giant with the axe winds up for a strike and Silvius, badly beaten and alone, charges towards him determined to make a last stand.

Silvius hits both fire giants with the spirits of Ilmater, badly injuring the one with the axe. However, the fire giants hit Silvius three time, causing him to fall to the ground as Ilmater's spirits fade away.

As Czolg continues to battle the northern fire giant with vicious strikes, the rest of the team is fending off the fire giants coming from the hallway to the south. ADC drops the wall and prepares to cast another spell. However, he quickly realizes Silvius is knocked out on the ground and calls out to the team to come to Silvius's aid.

As Fennuris and Kalinar fire blasts at the fire giant to the south, ADC casts another wall of ice that kills the axe-wielding giant and pushes the other one further back. Meanwhile, Oscorn casts a healing spell that revives Silvius and heals the rest of the team. Oscorn runs up to Silvius to check on him.

As Oscorn reaches Silvius to see if he's ok, the fire giant swings his sword over the wall of ice. Silvius, still on the ground and barely conscious, distracts the giant and saves Oscorn from being hit. The fire giant is furious at the miss and then swings his sword at Silvius. Silvius helplessly waits for the blow that will finish him off until Czolg notices what is about to happen and blocks the blow as his cloud rune glows. Silvius then calls out to the team, telling them to get into the room with him as he blocks the door with a wall of force.

ADC creates another wall of ice that damages the fire giants in the hallway, while Czolg and Fennuris back into the room as well. The fire giant in the room remains focused on Silvius and Oscorn, laughing at the bard lying on the ground. However, Oscorn commands the two nearest fire giant to flee, but only succeeds in distracting the fire giant in the hallway. 

With the fire giant's attention diverted, Czolg, Fennuris, and Kalinar rush closer to Silvius and Oscorn. Silvius stands up and creates a plane of force that blocks the hallway and knocks the fire giant in the room prone. He then runs around to the giant's back to distract him and yells "kill this one now!" Czolg charges and stabs the fire giant, Kalinar blasts him, and Fennuris finishes him off with an arrow to the head.

The team takes a moment to catch their breath while the fire giant continues to pound on the wall of force. Kalinar uses his tentacle to attack the fire giant, while Fennuris, Oscorn, and Czolg discuss their next move. Oscorn finishes the fire giant off by tolling the dead.

Silvius, who is weary and in need of a break, calls out to the team, "We need to take a break. Block the doors!" He uses magic to close half of the door to the north.

Czolg quickly runs up to the door, ready to defend the team, but several fire dogs appear outside the door. The first is stopped by Czolg, but it burns him with its flaming breath. A second fire dog breaks through the door and runs into the center of the room.

ADC frantically yells out, "We need to close the door!" as he tries to push the second half of the door shut, but he is unable to move the incredibly heavy giant-sized door.

Silvius, who knows that he cannot take a hit and maintain his focus on the wall of force, desperately searches for a place to hide from the fire dogs. He pushes on the tapestry to the east and feels it move. He quickly runs behind the tapestry to avoid the fire dog and finds a small room with a large chest on a table.

Fennuris takes aim and shoots the fire dog in the room, while Oscorn tolls the dead, killing the fire dog.

Finally, ADC uses magic to lock the northern door, securing the room from any further attackers.

Oscorn, seeing the tapestry to the east covered a passage, checked the tapestry on the southern wall and found another concealed space with a chest of drawers. 

Kalinar enters the room behind Silvius and inquires about what he sees. Silvius replies, "There are two other small chests in here, but the big one has something going on with the table it sits on." He points to the barely visible box surrounding the chest on the table.

Silvius attempts to pick the lock on the northern box but is unsuccessful. He then grabs a dusty map from the wall and hands it to ADC, asking him to examine it. Oscorn takes a look as well to see if he recognizes any historical significance. ADC and Oscorn both agree that it is just a decorative map. Silvius folds the map and puts it in his bag, saying, "I want to show my mom where we've been."

Kalinar's eyes widen as he gazes upon the big chest on the table and realizes that the outline in the table is a pressure plate trap. He attempts to disarm it, but unfortunately, sets it off. Six darts shoot out of the wall and all hit Kalinar, filling his body with poison.

Silvius utters a soothing word and wakes Kalinar up. He then asks Kalinar to try to open the small chest to the south. Despite being in a dazed stupor, Kalinar opens the box. However, he is still fixated on the big box on the table.

Oscorn walks over and cures Kalinar's poisoning. He then asks his gods to reveal any magic in the room. The only magic that glows is the massive axe the fire giant was carrying.

Silvius inspects the contents of the small chest to the south and finds gold and several bone batons inside. Silvius realizes he only has a few minutes left before he can no longer block the western door to the room with his wall of force.

Can the team catch a break in the heart of the Snure's volcano? What is in the remaining small chest to the north and large chest on the table? What are these mysterious bone batons? What else is in the southern concealed space?
