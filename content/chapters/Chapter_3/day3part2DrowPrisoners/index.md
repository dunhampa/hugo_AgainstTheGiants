WIP DRAFT

With Czolg firmly maintaining his hold on the captured Drow mage, the rest of the party approaches cautiously, their eyes scanning the surroundings for any potential threats. Oscorn, ever watchful, positions himself at the rear, ensuring they are not caught off guard from behind.

Kalinar takes the opportunity to engage the Drow mage in conversation and mock them in their loss "Your friends seemed eager to escape. What's the rush?" he asks, hoping to elicit a respons.

In a defeated and sullen tone, the Drow mage responds in Undercommon, a language unfamiliar to the team, rendering their efforts at understanding futile. Sensing the confusion and a window of opportunity to flee, the Drow glances around, a puff of mist enveloping her before she vanishes from the teams' sight.

ADC's pocket fairy companion, ever vigilant, catches a glimpse of another Drow materializing and disappearing in rapid succession. Oscorn, keeping a keen eye on the surroundings, notices a lever pushed upwards, seemingly controlling the door that the Drow burst through earlier. It becomes evident that the door can only be opened from one side.

There is another door to the fart east of the next room, which appears to be a prison cell. Kalinar attempts to force it open, but his efforts prove fruitless as it remains firmly secured from the other side. Searching the bodies of the fallen Drow, the team discovers several Drow shortswords and long dark staffs with a spider design on top. Additionally, they uncover three medallions and a brooch, intriguing artifacts that may hold further significance in their quest.

As the team takes a longer look in the second room, they are struck by its opulence and grandeur, far surpassing the previous chamber. The dark tapestries and floor coverings have been replaced with exquisite furnishings, including ornate cabinets, a lavish bed, elegant tables, sturdy coffers, a grand wardrobe, and several diwans.

Sensing the significance of this room, Silvius decides to ask Ilmater for guidence on if there is magic in the area, hoping to uncover any hidden enchantments or mystical energies. His spell reveals intriguing findings—a coffer positioned near the bed emanates a gentle glow from within, while another coffer situated between two diwans pulses with evocation magic, indicating it might be a trap. 

Exercising caution, Silvius and Kalinar carefully inspect the area around the seemingly safer coffer near the bed, diligently searching for any signs of traps. To their relief, they find no immediate indications of danger. Encouraged by their assessment, Silvius approaches the coffer and cautiously opens it.

Inside, they discover six potions, intriguingly distinct from conventional glass bottles. These vessels are instead intricately carved from stone, adorned with peculiar writings that appear unfamiliar to the team. The contents and properties of the potions remain unknown, leaving them with a sense of intrigue and curiosity.

Silvius carefully hands the stone-carved potions to ADC, knowing only ADC can take on the task of identifying their properties. ADC, utilizing his knowledge and expertise, examines each potion and then distributes them among the team.

He keeps the Potion of Poison for himself, recognizing its potential usefulness. The Potion of Mind Control, specifically tailored for influencing fire giants, is handed to Silvius, given his proficiency in magic and manipulation. Oscorn is entrusted with the Potion of Growth, a concoction that could enhance his already formidable ability to ho-door. Czolg receives the Potion of Heroism, a fitting tool to extend his bravery and prowess in battle. Lastly, Silvius receives both Filters of Love, perhaps with a hint of amusement in the allocation.

With the potions allocated, Silvius proposes a cautious approach to the magic coffer, recognizing its potential as a trap. He suggests thoroughly searching the room before proceeding further. The team collectively scours the chamber, scrutinizing every nook and cranny for any additional clues or hidden dangers.

In the midst of their search, Silvius stumbles upon a mysterious map, adorned with writings similar to those found on the stone potion vials. The discovery sparks intrigue and speculation, hinting at a possible deep connection between the map and the potions. 

As the team continues their thorough search of the room, it becomes evident that it once served as the abode of a high-ranking female figure. The surroundings exude an air of elegance and prestige. Among their findings, they uncover:

- A screen adorned with intricate amber inlays, a testament to the craftsmanship of its construction.
- A magnificent dress displayed on a mannequin, adorned with numerous jewels. Recognizing the value of the gemstones, the team carefully removes them from the dress and stores them away for safekeeping. The gems consist of 10 amethysts (100 gp each), 10 black opals (10 gp each), a topaz (50 gp), and 10 violet garnets (50 gp each). Oscorn takes charge of safeguarding these valuable gemstones in his bag.
- A goblet crafted from lapis lazuli, a prized possession worth an estimated 500 gp. Oscorn stows the goblet away in his bag, ensuring its protection.
- A large mirror, which reflects the team's collective gaze as they inspect their surroundings.
- Two combs, a brush, four hairpins, and ten jars containing cosmetics. These items are intricately crafted from silver and onyx, each inlaid with gems valued at 50 gp each. Silvius takes an interest in the makeup contained within the jars, carefully removing them for personal use, while Oscorn stores the remaining items in his bag.

In addition to the newfound treasures, the team also discovers more medallions and brooches, one on each of the fallen Drow. These insignias, perhaps denoting rank or allegiance, serve as further evidence of the significance of the adversaries they have encountered.

Heeding Silvius' instruction, the team retreats from the room, giving him space to deal with the trapped coffer using his mage hand. However, before Silvius can proceed, ADC interrupts him with a sense of urgency and annoyance in his voice. "Wait, wait, wait," ADC interjects, asserting that a more cautious approach is required when dealing with a magical trap.

ADC approaches the coffer and runs his hand over its surface, carefully sensing for any magical glyphs or triggers. As his hand glides over the coffer, a glyph briefly glows brightly but then fades away harmlessly. The team collectively breathes a sigh of relief, grateful for ADC's intervention.

Expressing his gratitude, Silvius proceeds to open the coffer, revealing three scrolls within protective sleeves. Silvius identifies the contents of each scroll:

- The first scroll, written in Elvish, is a Scroll of Greater Restoration. Recognizing its potential value, Silvius hands it to Oscorn, knowing that his divine abilities as a cleric will enable him to effectively utilize the scroll's restorative properties to aid their wounded allies.
- The second scroll is a Scroll of Divine Word, a potent spell that Silvius tucks away for future use.
- The third scroll, enclosed in an especially ornate sleeve, contains a truly powerful spell—Gate. Recognizing the immense power and significance of this spell, Silvius carefully hands it over to ADC, acknowledging his proficiency in magic.

In addition to the scrolls, the team also discovers several glowing rods, each adorned with three flowing tentacles at their tops. Recognizing their potential as formidable weapons, Kalinar, ADC, and Oscorn claim one rod each, each member wielding a tentacle rod for their use.

Acknowledging the need to tend to their wounds and recuperate, the team takes the opportunity to bandage their injuries and rest for an hour, allowing for a much-needed short rest to restore their strength and vitality.
