Operation Trundle Wagon continued their journey, delving deeper into the Underdark in pursuit of the elusive Drow. After weeks of traversing the ever-changing cave system, the rough-hewn walls transitioned into well-carved passages resembling a makeshift cobblestone road.

As the team pressed forward, the tunnel opened into a vast cavern with high ceilings, connected stalactite-like columns reaching from floor to ceiling. The sudden expanse induced an eerie feeling of dread after weeks in cramped, dark tunnels. Silvius, utilizing his eyes of night, spotted a long wooden bridge with two Drow guards on the other side.

"Halt, identify yourselves and stop your group on the bridge," commanded one of the Drow, while the other relayed the message to their comrades. Silvius introduced the team as traders seeking to establish a new trade route with the rising Drow. The Drow instructed them to return in a few hours to speak with Canon, the apparent authority.

Oscorn inquired about the house that owned the fortress, but the Drow provided no clear answer. Deciding to assess the fortress's potential threat, the team explored paths to the left of the bridge. To the west, they discovered a tunnel with dragon tracks, sending Silvius into a panic as memories of Brazamel, the terrible red dragon, flooded back.

Fennuris reassured Silvius that the tracks belonged to Drow, not dragons, mocking him slightly. Realizing this path likely led to the warrens and could take weeks to traverse, the team redirected their attention to the fortress.

Oscorn prayed for the gift of sight, manifesting an invisible eye that scouted the fortress's interior. Meanwhile, Czolg befriended a bat, using it to gather information on guards and potential entry points. With new insights, the team returned to Canon after several hours.

Approaching the bridge, they observed armed Drow on guard. In the middle stood a heavily armored female Drow with a mace, identifying the team as the group that attacked Drow on the surface. Silvius attempted to negotiate, emphasizing their non-hostile intentions, but she remained steadfast in her refusal.

The team devised a plan. Oscorn prayed again, summoning an angel that carried him across the channel. Simultaneously, Silvius teleported with Czolg next to the smoking Drow, and together they swiftly incapacitated him.

Oscorn's angel ferried the rest of the team across, and they quickly descended a hallway deeper into the fortress. Kalinar burst into a room, startling a sleeping Drow, who began screaming. ADC and Silvius silenced the Drow with magic and mockery.

Meanwhile, Oscorn and the others charged into a larger room to the north, startling two Drow sitting at a table. As they prepared to engage, Czolg screamed in horror at the sight of numerous doors in the roomâ€”a manifestation of his worst nightmare.
