Operation Trundle Wagon continued their journey, delving deeper into the Underdark in pursuit of the elusive Drow. After weeks of traversing the ever-changing cave system, the rough-hewn walls transitioned into well-carved passages resembling a makeshift cobblestone road.

As the team pressed forward, the tunnel opened into a vast cavern with high ceilings, connected stalactite-like columns reaching from floor to ceiling. The sudden expanse induced an eerie feeling of dread after weeks in cramped, dark tunnels. Silvius, utilizing his eyes of night, spotted a long wooden bridge with two Drow guards on the other side. They also noticed what seemed to be the start of a large Drow fortress that was directly in the team's way.


{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 2 OutPost.webp" Capition = "Drow fortress"  width = "60%" >}}


"Halt, identify yourselves and stop your group on the bridge," commanded one of the Drow, while the other relayed the message to their comrades. Silvius introduced the team as traders seeking to establish a new trade route with the rising Drow. The Drow instructed them to return in a few hours to speak with Canon, the apparent authority.

Oscorn inquired about the house that owned the fortress, but the Drow provided no clear answer. Deciding to assess the fortress's potential threat, the team explored paths to the left of the bridge. To the west, they discovered a tunnel with dragon tracks, sending Silvius into a panic as memories of Brazamel, the terrible red dragon, flooded back.

Fennuris reassured Silvius that the tracks belonged to Drow, not dragons, mocking him slightly. 

Oscorn prayed for the gift of sight, manifesting an invisible eye that scouted the fortress's interior. He searched some outdoor sections but couldn't get past the doors and windows to get a full view of what lay inside the fortress.

Czolg looked up at the bats hanging from the cave ceiling. A mischievous glint appeared in his eyes as he extended a hand towards one of them. "Hey, bat friend. Want some treats?".

To the surprise of the rest of Operation Trundle Wagon, the bat descended, fluttering down gracefully until it perched on Czolg's outstretched arm. The two engaged in what seemed like an animated conversation, filled with squeaks and gestures. The rest of the team exchanged amused glances.

Czolg pulled out a small pouch of rations and started stuffing bits of food into a nook in the cave wall. The bat eagerly nibbled at the offerings, seemingly appreciative of the unexpected feast. Czolg continued to talk and squeak in a language only he and the bat seemed to understand.

The bat, now content with its impromptu meal, took flight and disappeared into the darkness of the cave. Czolg turned back to the team, wearing a satisfied smile. "Bat friend here is checking out the guards for us." When the bat returned, Czolg continued the converstation and let the rest of the team know about the guards near the other bridge to the west. 

With new insights, the team returned to the front gate to meet Canon after several hours.

Approaching the bridge, they observed armed Drow on guard. In the middle stood a heavily armored female Drow with a mace, identifying the team as the group that attacked Drow on the surface. Silvius attempted to negotiate, emphasizing their non-hostile intentions, but she remained steadfast in her refusal.

The team walked way and devised a new plan. Oscorn prayed again, summoning an angel that carried him across the channel. Simultaneously, Silvius teleported with Czolg next to the smoking Drow, and together they swiftly incapacitated him.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 4 ANGEL FLIGHT.webp" Capition = "Divine flight"  width = "60%" >}}

Oscorn's angel ferried the rest of the team across, and they quickly descended a hallway deeper into the fortress. Kalinar burst into a room, startling a sleeping Drow, who began screaming. ADC and Silvius silenced the Drow with magic and mockery.

Meanwhile, Oscorn and the others charged into a larger room to the north, startling two Drow sitting at a table. As they prepared to engage, Czolg screamed in horror at the sight of numerous doors in the room—a manifestation of his worst nightmare.


{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 5 GRAND ROOM.webp" Capition = "The horror of the doors"  width = "60%" >}}

Kalinar rushed into the large well decorated room, his first blast misfiring into a cloud of smoke. His next two blasts found their mark, striking the Drow. In orcish, he yelled, "Get on the ground and you won’t be harmed," a command that went completely misunderstood by everyone else.

From his tiara, Oscorn could hear the Drow yelling, "To the south, to the south. Invaders to the south," alerting their comrades to the intrusion.

As Kalinar aimed to neutralize the threat, a Drow retaliated with a hand crossbow bolt, striking him. Despite the pain and the poison coursing through his veins, Kalinar fought through it. 

Drow reinforcements emerged from a northern door, adorned in studded leather and emerging from a lavishly decorated room. ADC summoned an earth elemental to counter the Drow mage's spells.


{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 6 DROW GUARDS.webp" Capition = "Drow rushing to attack"  width = "60%" >}}

Kazik the wolf remained vigilant, guarding the south passage where the team had entered, ensuring that no enemies could flank them or escape unnoticed. 

Silvius dashed into the large room and took cover under a nearby table, using it as a makeshift shield from the chaos erupting around him.

A massive lightning bolt crashed from the south, striking Oscorn, but surprisingly, he managed to dodge most of it, the electrical static still sparking between his armor plates as he entered the room alongside his companions.

Czolg, recognizing the danger of fighting in the open, made a decisive move, opening the door to the west next to Kalinar. Immediately, a Drow on the other side fired a hand crossbow, hitting Kalinar who stood beside Czolg.

Czolg charged into the adjacent room, which appeared to be a kitchen, and engaged the Drow in combat. Kalinar, still reeling from the crossbow bolt, managed to land a shot on one of the Drow, but a painful miss threw him off balance, forcing him to seek cover by the hearth near the fireplace.

As a bolt whizzed past ADC, he surged forward, his construct companion moving alongside him as they advanced toward the Drow.

Suddenly, the door to the northeast swung open, revealing two elves clad in dark studded leather armor and garbed in dark clothes, charging into the room with determined ferocity. A small glowing globe sailed through the air, striking the wall to the southwest and spreading a thick mist throughout that corner. Silvius attempted to intimidate the Drow responsible for the globe, but his efforts fell short as the Drow remained unfazed.


{{< imageToClickGlobal imagePath="/img/C4_P3_3_CANON_rotated.webp" imgPosition="left" Capition="The commander of the Drow fortress" rotate="90deg">}}

With bolts flying in every direction, one struck ADC, causing him to weaken and fall unconscious. Oscorn reacted swiftly, hurling a bead from his necklace of fireball, engulfing all the Drow to the northeast in flames and scorching the surroundings. Frantically, he tried to rouse ADC from his slumber amidst the chaos.

Czolg positioned himself by the door through which the team had entered, growing massive in stature to intimidate any foes who dared to approach.

As magical blasts of light shot across the room, Oscorn and Silvius dodged, but ADC began to glow green on the ground, his condition worsening. Kalinar summoned a mass of tentacles, ensnaring one of the Drow and injuring the others, while his cold tentacle by the door attempted to strike another, albeit unsuccessfully.

Meanwhile, a Drow clad in black armor charged in, striking Silvius before being shoved to the ground in retaliation. Silvius called out to Czolg for assistance, urging him to open the door for Kazik and come to his aid. Rushing to the far western side of the room, Silvius offered healing words to ADC as he passed, though ADC remained unconscious.

Another bolt from a Drow struck Silvius, causing him to collapse from the poison coursing through his veins. Surrounded by Drow, Silvius sustained a festering wound to his shoulder, the pain searing through him. Yet, amidst the peril, Czolg redirected a blow intended for Silvius, striking down the Drow assailant. 

As Silvius regained consciousness, his concern for his shoulder wound dissolved as he caught Oscorn's reassuring wink and silent promise of protection.

Silvius conjured a wall of force, pushing the enemies to the opposite side of the chamber as Kazik dashed inside to rouse ADC from unconsciousness.

With determination in his voice, Silvius rallied his companions, announcing, "I've erected a barrier. But those spiders will find a way over it. We must regroup."

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 9 SPIDER.webp" Capition = "Drow spiders"  width = "60%" >}}

Meanwhile, Oscorn unleashed another casting of Dawn, illuminating the area with a radiant column of sunlight that seared the Drow as they recoiled in agony.

Czolg suddenly appeared fixated, his focus diverted as he inexplicably launched into an attack on his friend ADC. His swings were wild and uncontrolled, missing their mark as Silvius intervened, distracting Czolg and ensuring that ADC remained unharmed by the frenzied assault. ADC swiftly dispelled the magic affecting Czolg, bringing him back from his bewildered state. As clarity returned, Czolg appeared shocked, realizing the actions he had taken under the influence of confusion.

Kalinar decided to bring some confusion of his own and cast his confusion spell upon the Drow to the north. Instantly, several of their adversaries found themselves engulfed in a whirlwind of disorientation. One of the Drow from the opulent chamber begain to pound futilely against the wall of force, his efforts in vain as he struggled to breach the magical barrier.

The oozing tree lurched toward the wall, scaling it with eerie determination. As it began to cast a spell, ADC intervened, disrupting its incantation with a well-timed dispel magic. Wispy webs cascaded down harmlessly, failing to ensnare the group thanks to ADC's quick thinking and decisive action.

Silvius acted swiftly, conjuring a forcecage around some of the most important looking Drow casting spells at the back, trapping them within its shimmering confines.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 11 FORCECAGE.webp" Capition = "Lock her up"  width = "60%" >}}

However, the Drow were not deterred, and another Drow directed a spell at Silvius. With quick reflexes, Silvius countered the spell, thwarting the Drow's attempt. But before he could celebrate his success, another Drow seized control of Silvius's body, lifting Silvius into the air with unseen force, leaving him suspended helplessly.

A sudden demonic presence manifested next to Oscorn and attempted to attack him.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 7 ELEMENTAL.webp" Capition = "The demon from the Drow is summoned"  width = "60%" >}}

Simultaneously, a noxious green cloud materialized, enveloping Czolg and Silvius, inflicting them with its foul stench that burned their skin. Silvius, struggling against the effects of the levitation and the poisonous fumes, desperately sought to free himself but found no solid ground to push against.

Now back to his senses, Czolg unleashed a ferocious barrage of blows with his spear, dispatching one of the giant spiders and then swiftly moving to confront and vanquish the summoned demon threatening Oscorn. Meanwhile, Kalinar unleashed a devastating blast of energy, annihilating the second spider with precision.

ADC summoned an earth elemental to join the fray, directing it to assail the oozing tree with relentless force.

As the battle raged on, Kazik, Silvius's loyal wolf companion, found himself illuminated by a strange green glow, courtesy of a faerie fire spell cast by an unknown assailant among the Drow ranks.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 12  FAERIE FIRE.webp" Capition = "Caught in the glow"  width = "60%" >}}

Determined to rejoin the fight, Silvius dispelled the levitation spell holding him aloft and rushed to join Czolg on the western side of the room. The Drow also launched a coordinated attack on ADC's summoned elemental. Their swords struck with brutal force, while arcane missiles found their mark, causing the elemental to stagger under the onslaught.


{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 13 ENEMY ELEMENTAL.webp" Capition = "Summoned darkness"  width = "60%" >}}

Sensing the urgency of the situation, Oscorn invoked a beacon of hope to bolster the spirits and resilience of his allies in the face of adversity and add even more power to his heals.

Undeterred by the noxious cloud enveloping him, Czolg charged forward, channeling his anger into his actions as he plunged headlong into the swirling mist.

Meanwhile, Kalinar's tentacle struck out at the nearby Drow with lethal precision. Kalinar turned to Silvius and voiced a grim assessment, suggesting that they might need to "get in to get out".

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 13 TENTACLE ATTACK.webp" Capition = "Kalinar ten-tickles"  width = "60%" >}}

Back in the hallway, Fennuris spotted a creature emerging around the corner and swiftly took aim, unleashing a precise shot that found its mark, hitting the charging Drow and momentarily halting their advance.

With unwavering focus, ADC targeted one of the Drow with a toll of the dead spell, weakening his foe before the earth elemental delivered the finishing blow, bringing the Drow to his knees.

Silvius summoned his courage and invoked the protection of Ilmater as he charged forward, darting between the two Drow assailants and the malevolent tree menacing the elemental. With a fervent plea to his deity, he unleashed a surge of divine energy, causing one of the Drow to falter and collapse, while the other was left grievously wounded.

In the hallway, Fennuris deftly dodged the poorly aimed bolts from the Drow's hand crossbows, narrowly avoiding their attacks.

Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Czolg found himself targeted by a barrage of bolts launched by the Drow lurking within. Though the bolts flew dangerously close, Czolg managed to evade them with agile movements.

As Silvius engaged the Drow mage in a tense magical duel, the sorcerer attempted to evade his grasp by casting a misty step spell to teleport to the other side of the chamber. However, Silvius remained vigilant and swiftly countered the mage's spellcasting efforts, thwarting his escape.

Another Drow mage materialized and attempted to weave a spell of his own, only to be met with a resolute defense from ADC, who countered the mage's incantation with his own magical prowess.

Meanwhile, Oscorn, with a resigned sigh at the setback, focused his efforts on providing healing support to Czolg, bolstering the warrior's resilience before pressing forward into the fray once more.

Suddenly, a wave of mysterious energy surged through the room, causing fallen Drow warriors to stir and rise once more, much to the bewilderment of ADC, who struggled to comprehend the nature of this unusual restorative magic.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 14 RESURRECTION.webp" Capition = "The Drow rise again"  width = "60%" >}}

In the midst of the chaos, the Drow leader made a futile attempt to restrain Silvius, but the determined Silvius shrugged off the feeble effort, pressing onward with unwavering resolve.

As the chaos unfolded around them, Czolg seized the opportunity to press the attack, charging forward with a ferocious determination. With a swift strike from the butt of his spear, he incapacitated one of the Drow assailants before surging forward to deliver a fatal blow to another. With his spear wielding deadly precision, Czolg swiftly dispatched the remaining adversary who had been facing off against the tentacle.

Meanwhile, Kalinar unleashed a devastating blast of energy, striking down one of the Drow assailants with a potent magical assault. Simultaneously, the tentacle lashed out at another Drow, ensnaring the foe in its grasp.

Elsewhere, a Drow archer took aim at Kazik, but Silvius, with a taunting jest, managed to distract the assailant, causing his shot to go astray.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 15 ARROWS.webp" Capition = "Drow returning fire"  width = "60%" >}}

However, the looming threat of the oozing tree diverted their attention, as it abandoned its assault on the elemental and charged menacingly towards Czolg. With a swift and decisive strike from his spear, Panzerfaust, Czolg halted the tree's advance, preventing it from reaching him.

Amidst the chaos, a Drow mage attempted to cast a paralyzing spell at Silvius and Kazik, but while Silvius managed to shake off the effects, Kazik fell victim to the paralysis. Silvius quickly sprang into action, freeing his faithful steed before urging him forward into the fray. Kazik charged forth, unleashing a barrage of spectral energies that struck down several Drow adversaries, while Silvius turned his attention to the Drow responsible for Kazik's paralysis, urging Czolg to deliver the final blow.

However, their respite was short-lived, as the door to the northeast swung open, revealing two formidable Drow adversaries who wasted no time in launching a barrage of spells at Silvius. With quick reflexes, Silvius managed to counter one of the spells, but the other succeeded in dispelling the protective spirits that had been menacing the nearby Drow.

Responding to Silvius's call, Czolg turned his attention to the oozing tree, swiftly dispatching the monstrous creature before charging northward. Though he missed his intended target, the Drow Commander identified by Silvius.

Meanwhile, Silvius found himself engaged in a fierce melee with the Drow Commander, exchanging blows with the formidable adversary. With a flaming sword in hand, Silvius retaliated with a swift strike before swiftly retreating towards the safety of the kitchen to the west.


{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 16 FLAMING SWORD.webp" Capition = "Silvius bravely strikes the Drow commander"  width = "60%" >}}

Kalinar unleashed another barrage of tentacles and blasts, finally vanquishing the Drow Commander.

Drow warriors next surged in from the south to launch a ferocious assault on Fennuris and Oscorn. Their poisoned swords struck true, inflicting painful wounds upon them both.

Oscorn managed to evade many of the incoming strikes through a combination of skillful dodges and fervent prayers for divine protection. However, the relentless barrage proved too much, causing him to lose concentration on his beacon of hope spell.

Meanwhile, Fennuris swiftly dodged past the Drow attackers, vanishing into the smoke-filled room beyond the door, seeking refuge from the relentless assault.

A powerful Drow mage emerged, wielding a potent spell that paralyzed Czolg with a magical force, rendering him immobile and vulnerable to further attacks.

As the situation grew increasingly dire, a glowing globe of magical energy struck Kazik, blinding the faithful wolf and leaving him disoriented amidst the chaos.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 8 EXPLODING GLOBE.webp" Capition = "Canon slinging magical fire"  width = "60%" >}}

Kalinar unleashed another powerful blast of energy, while one of his tentacles struck out at a nearby Drow, momentarily disrupting their advance.

Silvius charged forward atop the blinded Kazik, his flaming sword cutting through the ranks of Drow assailants with deadly precision. However, as he sought refuge behind a nearby door, a sudden and devastating blast of lightning tore through the barrier, engulfing Silvius and Kazik in a blinding flash of electricity and leaving them both lifeless on the ground.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 17 SILVIUS_DEATH_cleanup.png" Capition = "Silvius is knocked unconscious from the lighting bolt"  width = "60%" >}}

Oscorn found himself besieged by Drow attackers, their poisoned shortswords striking him with deadly precision. Despite the onslaught, Oscorn summoned his divine strength and skillfully dodged many of the incoming strikes, weaving through the melee with a combination of agility and divine protection.

Swiftly evading the Drow surrounding him, Oscorn threw a bead with precision, unleashing a fiery explosion that engulfed the area in flames. The blast incinerated everything in its wake, leaving charred remnants in its wake. With a divine word, Oscorn unleashed a wave of divine energy, obliterating most of the remaining Drow instantly while leaving the survivors stunned and blinded.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 18 FIREBALL NECKLACE.webp" Capition = "Oscorn fight off the drow with fire and the rath of his god"  width = "60%" >}}

Meanwhile, Czolg emerged from his paralyzed state as the Drow holding him fell to Oscorn's relentless onslaught. With renewed vigor, Czolg struck out at the nearest Drow, delivering two vicious blows that left the assailant reeling.

As the battle raged on, Kalinar unleashed another blast of energy, dispatching yet another Drow assailant who threatened Oscorn. However, Oscorn was not spared as another Drow struck him with a poisoned crossbow bolt, causing him to stagger and fall.


{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 19 OSCORN DEATH.webp" Capition = "Oscorn dropping from the Drow arrows and blades"  width = "60%" >}}

Fenurris targeted the drow mages as they recoiled in pain, picking them off with precise shots as they attempted to seek cover behind the doors to the east.

Kalinar rushed back to Silvius's side, administering a healing potion to revive him. Silvius wasted no time in returning to his feet, immediately rushing to Oscorn's aid. With a few healing words, Silvius restored Oscorn's strength before turning his attention to the nearby Drow assailant, dispatching him with a swift strike. With Oscorn now revived, Silvius urged him to seek safety in the kitchen before thanking Kalinar for his aid.

As the battle continued to unfold, ADC unleashed a flurry of steel wind strikes, cutting down several of the Drow warriors and mages scattered throughout the room. Commanding the earth elemental, ADC directed it to strike at a Drow to the south, further thinning the enemy's ranks.

Drow assailants swung their weapons at Oscorn, but his magical defenses allowed him to deftly evade their attacks. However, a Drow to the south began to move his hands in a manner similar to Kalinar's tentacles, prompting ADC to swiftly intervene and halt the Drow's spellcasting.

Another Drow cast a web, ensnaring ADC and Czolg in sticky strands. Sensing the danger, Oscorn vanished in a poof of mist and made his way north to join Kalinar and Silvius. Calling upon his god, Oscorn invoked a healing spell to restore his and Silvius's vitality.

Fennuris reappeared momentarily, firing off shots at several Drow before disappearing once more into the shadows.

Czolg pressed forward to the northeast, striking at the Drow with his spear before stepping back, poised for their next move. Kalinar, on the other hand, blasted a Drow before rushing to the nearby bedroom, gathering up documents and books and stowing them away in his bag of holding.

Despite sustaining a hit from a poisoned bolt, Czolg shook off the effects as ADC unleashed a fireball, incinerating more Drow foes. Silvius reentered the room, taunting the remaining Drow near ADC's elemental before retreating back into the safety of the kitchen. Informing Oscorn of the absence of the powerful casters and globe thrower, Silvius ensured the team remained informed of the changing dynamics of the battlefield.

In a strategic move, Oscorn stepped forward, bestowing the blessing of the spell beacon of hope upon Czolg, ADC, Silvius, and himself, bolstering their spirits and enhancing their abilities. Meanwhile, Fenuris, ever elusive, vanished once again from sight, ready to strike from the shadows when the opportunity presented itself.

Czolg, catching his breath and feeling the adrenaline coursing through his veins, takes a moment to rally the team. "Are we pressing on or what?" he asks, his voice resolute.

Kalinar, fueled by determination, charges into the large room, his magic crackling in anticipation of battle.

ADC, ever agile, darts forward, skillfully dodging any potential threats in his path.

Silvius, his lantern ablaze with magical light, re-enters the main room, his senses keen and alert.

Oscorn, cautious and strategic, urges the team to consider their next move carefully. "Maybe we shouldn't just charge through the northern door?" he suggests, prompting a moment of reflection.

Fennuris materializes once more, agreeing to hold their position and await further instructions.

After a brief discussion, the team resolves to proceed through the door to the northeast. Silvius and Kalinar hastily flip over a nearby table to provide cover, while the rest of the team readies themselves for whatever lies beyond.

With a wave of his hand, Silvius magically swings the door open, revealing a scene of eerie silence. Inside the room, they find a powerful forcecage containing three lifeless bodies, blood staining the floor around them. Silvius is taken aback, his mind racing with questions. How did these bodies end up in such a formidable cage of pure force? It was a mystery that left him perplexed and uneasy.

Concerned by what he's seeing, Silvius casts detect magic, his senses probing for any signs of arcane energy. His attention is drawn to a faint glow emanating from the fallen commander, and upon closer inspection, he discovers it's coming from a case of crossbow bolts nearby. Silvius retrieves the case, intrigued by its significance.

Turning his attention to the fancy bedroom presumed to belong to the fallen Drow commander, Silvius searches for any clues or items of importance but comes up empty-handed, further deepening the mystery surrounding their current situation.

As the team delves deeper into the rooms to the northeast, Oscorn begins his search, scouring the area for any items of interest. Here's what he finds:

Pile of Papers
Bones around a lamp
Book from Table
Very nice book from end table
Kris
4 carved art objects with 25 gold pieces each


{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 20 ROOM SEARCH.webp" Capition = "Undeterred, they pressed forward, deeper into the cave"  width = "60%" >}}

Meanwhile, Kalinar focuses on the other bedroom, swiftly gathering all the papers from the table and books from the shelf into his bag.

While exploring, Oscorn encounters a door that burns his hand when he attempts to open it. Stepping back, he resorts to using magic to open it safely.

Czolg, in his search, accidentally strikes a crate, perhaps hoping to find something of value inside.

ADC, displaying a more laid-back approach, strolls into the main room and takes a seat on one of the couches, issuing a casual request for any noteworthy discoveries from the team.

Silvius, utilizing his keen magical senses, discerns evocation and abjuration magic on the door that caused Oscorn harm. He dispels the magic, alerting Oscorn to the potential danger lurking to the north. Silvius is stunned with what he sees behind the door. It looks like a horrible ritual sacrifice was completed here. The body still lay in the center of the room covered in darkness and spiders.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 P3 21 RITUAL ROOM.webp" Capition = "Ritual room with sacrifice"  width = "60%" >}}

In the bedroom, Oscorn uncovers four art objects and a bag of holding within the magical glow detected by Silvius.

Kalinar rushes ahead and opens the previously trapped door, revealing a gruesome sight—a human sacrifice gruesomely cut in half within a horrifyingly decorated room. Silvius, visibly shaken by the sight, quickly moves on to check the next room.

After examining the contents of the bedroom, Silvius reports back to the group, noting that nothing within the room emits a magical glow.

Czolg continues to smash and fail to smash crates in disappointment.

ADC takes the magic bolt offered by Silvius. ADC lets him know it's a bolt of vapors that casts stinking cloud when it is fired. Silvius packs up the bolt in the case and staps it to his waste.

As Silvius investigates the other bedroom, his attention is drawn to a glowing scroll case, prompting him to share his findings with the rest of the team. He shares the six scrolls he finds with ADC. 

The team decides to take a break and all bandage their wounds and rest in the large fancy bedroom. Silvius brings back Kazik the wolf. 

After time passes, the forcecage holding the high level priestess in fine clothing and two other Drow. The clothing on the priestess seem like they would be worn by someone important. She carries is a five tailed scourge. Design on handle and everything that matches the symbols in the sacrifice room. She also is wearing an Elserves medalion that Silvius takes. 

They search the remaining drow fighters and mages and don't find much of any interest. They find some regular weapons and spell components. They also find several vials of poison on the Drow fighters, but have no idea how to use it. Silvius grabs two vials. Silvius also goes to the armory and takes several pieces of Drow armor and weapons and puts them in his bag of holding:

5 shortswords 
5 hand crossbows
50 crossbow bolts
5 daggers
5 setos of Drow leather armor. Each set is well made and of a different world

The team also divides the spell scrolls:

Fennuris takes a 2nd level find traps scroll
Kalinar a 3rd level tongues scroll and the potion of superior healing 
Oscorn the 4th level cure wounds and a 2nd level protection from poison scroll 
Silvius the 2nd level heat metal and a scroll of stone tell

OTR then decides to carry on from the fotress, but not before Czolg has one final snack from the kitchen.
