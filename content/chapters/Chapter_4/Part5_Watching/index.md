As the team presses on, the walls of the tunnel gradually become smaller and tighter. After traveling for what feels like several days, their progress is hindered by steeper drops and tougher passes.

Eventually, they arrive at a fork in the tunnel. To the left, the pathway bends, while to the right, another tunnel extends, appearing to be about the same size as the main route. After much debate, they opt to continue on the main path.

The tunnel continues to narrow, shrinking from ten to fifteen feet wide to a mere five feet. They find themselves having to make squeezes through the increasingly confined space. Despite the smaller size, the tunnel begins to smooth out again.

As they advance, they spot light up ahead. Proceeding cautiously, with Oscorn and Silvius leading the way, they pass what seems to be a doorway, and the room suddenly opens up before them.

Crystals on the walls illuminate the cavern. Large columns rise to the north and south, stretching from floor to ceiling. Silvius detects magic permeating the room. Silvius carefully and slowly walks across the room, and as he steps forward, the lights dim. Stepping back, the illumination returns to its previous brilliance. Silvius decides to send Kazik forward. Kazik seems slighly displeased to be used as a trap finder once again, but accepts the mission.

Kalinar examines the crystal on the wall to the northeast, noticing what appears to be a handle that could be moved. Curiosity piqued, he pulls the handle, and the lights quickly fill the room again. Silvius sends Kazik forward cautiously, then Kalinar returns the lever to its original position.

As time passes, they observe the lights dimming gradually: after two minutes, they're a quarter of the way dim; at five minutes, they're halfway dim; and by eight minutes, they're three-quarters dim. Approaching the ten-minute mark, the stone begins to grind from the far wall, revealing a spiraling hole. Silvius walks through it, finding himself in a room eerily mirroring the previous one.

ADC has a realization: the room's transmutation properties are mirroring the control of movement between rooms, essentially functioning as a complex locked door. He explains this to the team with an air of superiority and aloofness.

Past the puzzeling door, the narrow path ahead continues, requiring a long traverse and consuming considerable time. After another half day of travel, the team begins to feel the need to rest and recuperate.

Silvius excited tells the team he has been working on a new place for them to sleep. He spends a minute playing a song and conjures a mansion. The team is stunned by the comfort they find in this amazing place. They begin to search through many of the books and documents they found in the Drow fortress. Silvius calls upon his legion of servants to help with organizing the paperwork and clean the team's gear. One of the first, was a letter written in Drow among the papers after thorough searching.

ADC hold up the letter and attempts to decipher its contents, sounding out the words as Oscorn listens intently. Oscorn uses the power of his tiara to understand the meaning of the letter.

Oscorn translates it aloud for all to hear. In the letter, Ombi, the horrible lying dwarf that will definitely be killed when seen again, expresses a desire to create weapons within the vault capable of slicing through stone. The team realizes the vault is clearly an important place for the Drow to manufactur weapons for their assalt on the above. 

As servants organize paperwork, we eat and enjoy a drink, diving into the contents of the papers. Most of them are orders from various Drow elves of different ranks. Common names such as Cannon and Viondril repeatedly appear in the orders, along with some addressed to unnamed priestesses.

Among the books, we find texts on tactics, notes on Underdark monsters, and other military passages. Loose papers contain details on shipments and deliveries.

There are also books of prayers, with no trace of magical content, only religious in nature.

There are also military orders from Elserves and Despana catch our attention, along with references to Nadaline's passage and a comprehensive list of all the houses involved.

The military book details the application of poison to blades, while another provides specific care instructions for armor, emphasizing the detrimental effects of prolonged exposure to sunlight.

A book on monsters catches our eye, referencing various creatures including ants, giant bugs, beetles, and spiders.

Lastly, the book of seances delves into the gruesome process of dismemberment and execution, all in reverence to Lolth, the queen mother.

In addition to the wealth of information gathered from the books, the adventurers uncover the necessity of spending a night with tentacle rods in the vault to attune to them. They also learn about the capabilities of these rods, enhancing their understanding of their potential applications.

They also can find and identify the symbols associated with each of the houses, aiding them in deciphering the various orders and documents they've come across.

Leaving the safety of the mansion after a long and wonderful rest, the group resumes their journey through the narrow passage, which gradually narrows further, sometimes requiring them to squeeze through tight spaces. They encounter steep slopes that necessitate the use of ropes for descent, making progress slow and arduous.

After some time, they again decide to take another rest within the comforting confines of Silvius's magnificent mansion, regaining their strength.

As they continue the next day, the caves level out, and the sides become smoother, resembling less of a natural cave and more of a deliberately crafted structure. Despite the newfound ease of passage, a sense of unease settles over the group as they all feel the weight of unseen eyes upon them.

Silvius, attuned to the magical energies around him, begins to detect traces of magic, flicking on the lantern of revealing to shed light on any hidden enchantments. Their path leads them to a carved staircase descending to the ground, dropping about ten feet. Above them, the ceiling stretches incredibly high, shrouded in a dense fog.

Entering the area cautiously, Fennuris discovers tracks on the ground, seemingly humanoid but with longer feet and toes. They also find traces of giant and reptilian claw footprints, hinting at a diverse array of inhabitants within the cavern.

Silvius takes flight, soaring into the air to investigate the conjuration magic emanating from the fog above. Silvius spots a stone giant slowly approaching from the far end of the cave, while Kalinar catches sight of another giant to the southwest. With a sense of urgency, Kalinar warns the team of the approaching threat.

Thinking quickly, Silvius charges forward on his pegasus mount, urging it to gallop around the corner to find the giants. Czolg remains vigilant, keeping an eye out for any signs of danger near Kalinar.

Suddenly the entire group hears a familiar sound as the giant sounds its horn. The entire team sighs at this familar and Czolg lets out a "Again?!?, Silvius!"

The stone giant charges at the team and utters a slow and eerie "felsh" before clumsily swinging his club at Fennuris, only to lose his balance and tumble to the ground. Seizing the opportunity, Kalinar, gripped by fear, conjures another small fog cloud and blinds the giant with a well-aimed shot to his eye.

Silvius swoops back into the fray with the others, taunting the fallen giant as he lands. Czolg, unimpressed by the commotion, transforms into a giant himself and delivers a devastating blow that swiftly ends the stone giant's life.

Meanwhile, Oscorn cautiously peeks around the corner and whispers that there are no more giants lurking nearby. Kalinar and Fennuris, poised for battle, stand ready as Silvius lands and prepares to engage the stone giant.

Czolg jests at Silvius for his failure to apprehend the other giant, prompting Fennuris and Oscorn to press forward. Oscorn spots a group of lizards ahead, one of which repeats the ominous word "felsh."

Without hesitation, Silvius flies in on Kazik's back and lands beside Oscorn just as the lizards charge, launching their attack. As one of the lizards begins casting a spell at Oscorn, Silvius swiftly intervenes, intercepting the spell with a deft block.

Czolg charges forward, and Fennuris unleashes a barrage of arrows at the oncoming lizards, aiming to thin their numbers and turn the tide of battle in their favor.

Kalinar swiftly dispatches the lizard casting spells with a series of powerful blasts, while ADC moves closer to join the fray.

Silvius, ever the master of verbal combat, delivers a lethal mockery that slays one of the lizards. A stone giant charges forward, swinging wildly at the pegasus but narrowly missing and nearly losing grip of his club in the process. Another stone giant, however, lands a solid blow on the pegasus, dealing significant damage.

In the heat of battle, Fennuris takes aim at the stone giant in the hallway, landing several shots with her bow. Kalinar follows suit, blasting the stone giant with magic, but the recoil knocks him unconscious.

ADC summons a construct to aid in the fight, which proceeds to pummel the stone giant relentlessly. The pegasus, in a desperate attempt to gain the upper hand, shoves the stone giant to the ground, allowing Silvius to deliver a cutting mockery.

Tragedy strikes as a lizard skewers the pegasus with a spear, ending its valiant effort. Undeterred, Czolg delivers a series of critical stabs to the prone stone giant, ultimately delivering a fatal blow.

Another stone giant charges into the room, attacking ADC's construct, prompting Fennuris to rain arrows upon it.

ADC rouses Kalinar back to consciousness and implores assistance for his elemental. Silvius uses his magic to lull a lizard to sleep and inspire Czolg to greater feats of combat prowess.

Silvius distracts some of the damage from the stone giant's attack on the elemental, tending to the construct's feelings in the process much to ADC's delight.

A stone giant from the south emerges, catching Fennuris off guard. She quickly disengages and retreats, while Oscorn swings at the stone giant but misses, casting sanctuary on himself for protection. Kalinar, weakened but still fighting, unleashes another blast of magic before succumbing to exhaustion.

ADC's elemental delivers a devastating blow, vanquishing one of the stone giants.

Silvius quickly revives his fallen pegasus with a healing word, but before the majestic creature can fully recover, the stone giant strikes it down once more. Undeterred, Silvius unleashes another mocking taunt at the giant.

Czolg steps forward, delivering a powerful blow to the stone giant, even managing to land an inspired hit with the butt of Panzerfaust. Fennuris unleashes a barrage of arrows at the giant to the south, striking true with each shot.

Oscorn, filled with fury, dodges the giant's attacks while hurling abusive insults in return. Kalinar summons his tentacles to assault the giant to the south, causing chaos in its midst.

ADC's elemental continues its relentless assault on the stone giant to the north, while Silvius rouses his pegasus once more, urging it to disengage and retreat to safety in the south.

Silvius continues his verbal assault on the stone giant, goading it with cutting remarks. Czolg's wild swing lands a solid hit, while Fennuris's arrows find their mark once again.

Oscorn's attempts to provoke a reaction from the giant are met with silence, prompting him to continue dodging its attacks. ADC commands his construct to dispatch the sleeping lizard, which it does with brutal efficiency.

Silvius rushes south, continuing to mock the stone giant, while the pegasus lands next to ADC's elemental. Silvius instructs ADC to have the elemental mount the pegasus and head south to confront the approaching lizards.

Oscorn joins the fray, confirming the presence of more lizards to the south. Kalinar, taking aim with his magic, blasts the casting lizard and dispatches him with a lethal strike.

ADC dashes south, dodging incoming attacks, while his elemental mounts the pegasus and flies towards the oncoming lizards. The lizards charge at the group, swinging wildly as Czolg charges forward, striking down one of the attackers. Fennuris, true to her aim, swiftly dispatches another lizard with her arrows.

As the chaos unfolds, Oscorn deftly maneuvers around the lizard, avoiding its attacks. A lizard swings at Silvius but misses its mark. Oscorn seizes the opportunity and dispatches the other lizard near Kalinar with a well-aimed toll the dead spell.

ADC rushes forward, casting toll the dead at a nearby lizard. His elemental leaps off the pegasus and joins the fray, striking down the targeted lizard before claiming its club. Meanwhile, Kalinar finds himself surrounded by lizards, enduring their relentless onslaught.

Czolg, in a daring move, takes a swing but loses his balance and falls to the ground. Despite his fall, he manages to strike down a lizard before scrambling back to his feet. Fennuris, displaying her prowess with the bow, takes down one lizard after another, her arrows finding their marks with deadly precision.

Oscorn attempts to grapple a lizard but is pushed aside before he can gain a hold. The battle intensifies as the adventurers continue to fend off the relentless assault of the lizard foes.

Kalinar steps back and unleashes a series of magical blasts, swiftly dispatching one of the lizards. Silvius, utilizing his arcane abilities, puts two of the remaining lizards to sleep, momentarily halting their aggressive advance.

However, the respite is short-lived as more lizards emerge from around the corner, one of them attempting to cast a spell only to be thwarted by Kalinar's quick intervention. The others ready their javelins, preparing for the impending confrontation.

Meanwhile, Fennuris, ever vigilant, notices something stirring within the billowing clouds above her head, moving at a slow pace. Before she can fully discern what it is, Oscorn unleashes a powerful dawn spell over the lizards, instantly vanquishing them all.

In the aftermath of the spell, Kalinar, not realizing Silvius's intention, blasts the sleeping lizards, effectively ending their lives. Silvius, stunned and confused by Kalinar's actions, had hoped to glean valuable information from the incapacitated foes, leaving him grappling with a sense of missed opportunity and regret.

As the tension mounts in the cavern, Silvius takes action, dispelling the fog by manipulating the water in the air. Kazik, ever valiant, charges at the beholder, attempting to push it down but only manages to push it back as it hovers in the air.

Not one to back down from a challenge, Czolg charges at the beholder, ready to confront it head-on. The beholder, sensing the threat, tries to bite Kazik and evades Czolg's attacks as it darts around in the air.

In a desperate attempt to reason with the beholder, Oscorn speaks out, apologizing for any offense and explaining their simple quest to find a path back to the drow. However, there is no immediate response from the beholder.

Meanwhile, Kalinar and Silvius opt to hold their attacks, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. Kazik, demonstrating his strength, picks up Czolg and flies him back towards the beholder, while Czolg readies himself for an attack with a confident smile.

Sensing the impending confrontation, Fennuris holds her attack, waiting for the right moment to strike. Suddenly, the beholder unleashes a ray at Kazik, turning the Pegasus to dust, prompting everyone to yell in unison, urging each other to attack.

Czolg strikes the beholder with his spear, Silvius successfully mocks it, and Fennuris's arrows fly through the air, accompanied by Kalinar's powerful blasts of magic. Oscorn adds his toll the dead spell to the onslaught.

As the combined assault intensifies, Silvius delivers the final blow with a mocking taunt, ultimately slaying the beholder. With the threat neutralized, everyone looks around, holding their attacks, wondering if there are any more dangers lurking in the shadows.

As another beholder, pale and with a seemingly lifeless eye, appears out of the fog before them, Silvius wastes no time and transforms it into a frog with a wave of his hand. The beholder frog plummets from the sky, met with a swift arrow from Fennuris's bow.

Suddenly, a much larger and infinitely more menacing beholder emerges, its terrifying presence sending shivers down the adventurers' spines. With a single glance, it disintegrates the pegasus, leaving Silvius reeling from the loss.

Undeterred, Czolg charges forward, ready to face the monstrous foe head-on. Oscorn follows suit, casting toll the dead on the beholder in an attempt to weaken it.

However, Kalinar's connection with his patron falters in the presence of the beholder's intense light. Sensing the danger, he quickly moves out of the light and feels his connection restored. He warns the team not to cast spells within the beholder's cone of light, lest they suffer a similar fate.

Silvius summons his spirit guardians to aid in the battle, and the zombie beholder falls under their relentless assault. In retaliation, the beholder casts a ray of fright on Silvius, sending a wave of fear coursing through him.

The beholder unleashes a powerful ray of death energy at Oscorn, severely injuring him and leaving him reeling from the pain. The beholder then turns its attention to Czolg, delivering a powerful blow that nearly knocks him unconscious, though he manages to cling to consciousness.

Czolg transforms into a giant and charges beneath the beholder, thrusting his spear upward in a desperate attempt to wound the creature. Meanwhile, Oscorn, despite his injuries, tries to cast toll the dead, but his efforts fail. He then attempts to reason with the beholder, pleading with it and explaining their unintentional intrusion into its territory.

Suddenly, a ray of energy erupts from the wall, forming an eye that shoots a devastating beam at Czolg, inflicting massive necrotic damage upon him. The adventurers find themselves facing a formidable opponent, and the battle grows increasingly dire as they struggle to withstand the beholder's relentless assault.

ADC channels his magic, casting toll the dead once more and inflicting further damage upon the beholder. Silvius, displaying his agility, narrowly dodges a retaliatory attack from the beholder's eye beam.

However, the beholder's assault continues unabated, as it targets Czolg with another eye beam, putting him into a deep slumber. Undeterred, Fennuris unleashes a flurry of arrows at the beholder, each finding its mark and further weakening the monstrous creature.

The beholder's defenses falter, and it crashes to the ground, its formidable form succumbing to the relentless barrage of attacks from the adventurers. As the dust settles, Czolg awakens, startled but unharmed, as the team looks on in shock at the sudden demise of their fearsome foe. The viciousness of the beholder's attacks and its subsequent defeat leave the adventurers both relieved and astonished at the outcome of their hard-fought battle.

Navigating through the labyrinthine cave system proved to be a daunting task for the adventurers, as they frequently found themselves separated and in need of regrouping to ensure their safety in the twisting tunnels.

Eventually, they stumbled upon a group of five lizard men, each displaying vibrant colors and appearing well-rested. Silvius took the initiative to search the leader but found nothing of interest among their possessions. Czolg attempted to rouse one of the slumbering lizard men with a slap, but to no avail.

Deciding to disarm the lizard men, the group confiscated their weapons, which Silvius meticulously packed away in his bag of holding. Encouraged by Czolg, Silvius left a note behind for any potential followers, informing them of the demise of the beholder and instructing them to wait at their current location.

Continuing their exploration, the adventurers encountered a pit and a designated sleeping area, providing them with a brief respite before pressing on. Crossing the pit carefully, they delved deeper into the winding hallways, they also find a stone giant similarly asleep. They toss his club and stones in to the pit and continue their search.

Exploring further into the cave, the adventurers discovered a room adorned with two glowing crystals, with a passage leading deeper into the cavern on the opposite side. Pressing onward, they reached the end of a hallway and entered another room.

This chamber was peculiar, with the ground devoid of fog but heavily obscured by mist beginning about thirty feet above. Silvius, determined to unravel the mystery, mounted his faithful pegasus Kazik and took to the air. Circling below the fog, Silvius observed the magical aura within but discerned nothing else of note.

Convinced that they had stumbled upon the beholder's lair, Silvius ascended higher into the fog, gradually spiraling upwards until he spotted something intriguing on the southwestern portion of the wall. Drawing nearer, he dispelled the fog with a wave of magic, revealing an entryway large enough to accommodate a beholder.

Entering the room, Silvius dismounted Kazik and beheld a sight that stirred the hearts of adventurers—a pile of treasure gleaming with magical radiance. With determination in his heart, Silvius sent Kazik flying back down to fetch the rest of the team, eager to share in the discovery of this hidden trove.

ADC is amazed at the three legendary magical items they found:

A vorpal scimitar that he hands to Kalinar
A ring of djinni summoning given to Fennuris
A swoard of answering known as the Replyer. This longsword ADC keeps for himself since it suites his style and temperment perfectly

They also find 5,000 gold in treasure that is placed in Oscorns bag of holding.

After defeating the beholder and uncovering its treasure hoard, the adventurers took some time to explore the rest of the beholder's cavern.

Venturing into another passage, they stumbled upon a kitchen. The room was a chaotic mess, with flies buzzing everywhere and the stench of decay permeating the air. The team spread out, searching through the grime. They found an assortment of bugs, beetles, and rats, indicating that the kitchen had been used recently, albeit in a very unhygienic manner.

Czolg led the team down another dimly lit hall. As he proceeded, he saw what appeared to be a humanoid figure standing eerily still. Czolg approached and realized that the figure was a statue. Moving further into the hall, he found more of these statues, each one frozen in time. It became apparent that this was a macabre trophy room, showcasing the petrified remains of the beholder's defeated foes.

The statues depicted a variety of underdark creatures, their faces twisted in their final moments of terror. Among them were two figures that stood out: one elf and one human, both of whom bore the distinct features of surface dwellers. They were positioned prominently, as if the beholder had taken particular pride in these conquests. The silent hallway, lined with these tragic figures, told a haunting story of the beholder's malevolence and power.

Oscorn casts greater restoration on the elf statue. Stone cracks and shatters, peeling off the elf’s body. The elf falls to his hands and knees, taking deep, ragged breaths. Oscorn steps forward, placing a comforting hand on the elf's shoulder. "You are freed from the power of OTR and Sehanine Moonbow."

The elf, regaining his senses, looks up at Oscorn with confusion. "Where am I?"

Oscorn responds, "We are in the Underdark, my friend. Deep down. We are in an offshoot of the main cavern system. We encountered and defeated a beholder with eye rays and foul magic. We stumbled into this room and found you, along with many others who have met a similar fate."

"I don’t remember this place. I don’t remember you," the elf says, bewildered.

"We don’t know you either. We just found you, but you are welcome to stay with us," Oscorn reassures him.

"Where are we?" the elf asks again, looking around at the unfamiliar surroundings.

"Allow us to share our tale," Oscorn says, turning to Silvius. "Silvius?"

Silvius steps forward, recounting the tale of Operation Trundle Wagon. He speaks of their start together in Grugnoe, their journey through the ice and the volcano, and their explorations in the Underdark that led them to this moment.

The elf listens intently before introducing himself. "I am Iranus, from the elvish city of Lanith. My group of rangers and I were traveling here, looking for certain beings when we stumbled upon this labyrinth."

Oscorn asks, "What were you searching for?"

"I was the leader of my expedition. We were looking for the Illithids, the mind flayers. They were using their powers on us and experimenting on us, and we came to neutralize the threat. We started seeing giant spiders and drow as well. We found ourselves very lost and eventually encountered the Illithids. We fought a battle against the beholder and his minions, and here we are."

"What year is it?" Oscorn inquires.

"It is the year 544," Iranus replies.

Oscorn looks somber. "Well, sorry to say, but you’ve been like that for forty years. Are any of these others your companions?"

Iranus glances around at the petrified figures. "I recognize none of these. None even look like surface elves."

"Did you find the creatures you were looking for?" Silvius asks.

"We found a hideout, a place where they were conducting their mind experiments. We ran a long way. I couldn’t say how to get to the place again," Iranus admits.

"Let's get you some rest," Silvius suggests, creating his magnificent mansion. A shimmering door appears, inviting them inside.

They all enter and take a much-needed rest. After some time, Silvius and Oscorn decide to step outside to have another look at the statues. They examine them noting that four of them have trading brooches, but nothing indicating a direct Drow house affiliation.

Meanwhile, inside the mansion, Kalinar sits with Iranus and the others over a meal while servants tend to them. Kalinar asks Iranus if he could identify where he had been, showing him a map.

Iranus looks at the map thoughtfully. "We followed trails and snuck around where we could. It was more sneaking and exploring than following a clear path."

After Silvius and Oscorn step outside the mansion, Oscorn approaches another statue, this time of a human in tattered clothes with a terrified look on his face. Oscorn casts the spell greater restoration to free the man. Stone breaks off the man's body, and he falls to the ground, curling into a fetal position. Slowly, he faces Oscorn and opens his eyes, then begins to push back, eventually backing into a corner.

"Easy, friend, easy," Oscorn says gently. "We are travelers here and found you turned to stone. We are Operation Trundle Wagon. We saved you."

The man responds in a fearful, uncertain voice, speaking in Undercommon. "I’m sorry. The masters. Are you the masters? The new masters?"

Oscorn, confused by the title, replies, "I'm not sure what you mean by 'masters,' but we rescued one other."

"Not masters," the man insists, pointing to the other statues.

Kalinar, trying to help, asks in Orcish, "Did their faces look like this?" He mimics the visage of a mind flayer wiggling his fingers like a beard.

The human stares blankly, not understanding.

Oscorn approaches slowly, noticing how skittish the man is. "Do you have a name?"

"Shadowscar," the man replies.

Oscorn continues, "Shadowscar, what are your last memories before seeing me?"

Shadowscar, talking nervously and with many gestures, says, "The fight. And the run. And lost. And the light."

"Is Undercommon your first language?" Oscorn asks, realizing that Shadowscar has likely been in the Underdark for some time and has adapted to speaking in short, broken phrases.

"How did you serve the masters?" Oscorn inquires.

"Smith. Was a smith," Shadowscar responds.

"Which house did you work for?" Oscorn asks.

"No house. Duergar," Shadowscar replies, referring to the Underdark dwarves.

Oscorn shows him the tentacle rod. "Have you seen this before?"

"Not metal. Need metal, do damage," Shadowscar says, shaking his head.

Shadowscar continues, putting together more phrases, "Run, fight. Me and others. Fight. And run. Escape. Run from Duergar."

"What year do you think it is?" Oscorn asks gently.

"No," Shadowscar replies resolutely, staring back at Oscorn intently.

Oscorn tells him, "We are heading through the Underdark to a drow market. You’re welcome to join us."

Shadowscar looks wary. "New. Tall masters."

"No," Oscorn says firmly. "Friends."

When Shadowscar stands up, the team can see he is gaunt and covered in scars. Silvius leads him inside the mansion, instructing the servants to help clean him up. Shadowscar follows hesitantly, glancing back at the statues lining the hall.

Inside the mansion, as the servants attend to Shadowscar, the team gathers around to discuss their next steps. Shadowscar sits quietly, eating slowly and observing the group with a mixture of curiosity and fear.

Oscorn reassures him, "You’re safe with us, Shadowscar. We will help you find your way."

Oscorn steps back outside and approaches the statue of a drow with a mushroom brooch. He casts greater restoration, and the stone cracks and falls away. The drow, now freed, starts to collapse, but Oscorn catches him.

"We are friends," Oscorn says reassuringly. "We rescued you from the stone of the beholder's gaze."

"The treasures, the treasures!" the drow exclaims, looking around frantically. He sees the unfamiliar surroundings and becomes visibly distraught.

Oscorn explains how Operation Trundle Wagon found him. "We stumbled upon you and your companions turned to stone. We've come to help."

"The cargo! Everything we were carrying is gone. Everyone is gone!" The drow looks around desperately, searching for anything recognizable. "My group. My companion. We were looking for a shortcut, thought it would be less dangerous."

Fennuris shakes her head. "Nope."

Oscorn asks, "Who is your companion?"

"Elandra. My partner," the drow replies, his voice filled with sorrow. "We came across these goods, figured we’d get them to the market."

He stands and runs to a nearby statue, grabbing at its stone form and yelling, "Elandra!" Tears stream down his face as he sobs at her feet.

Oscorn places a hand on his shoulder. "What's your name?"

"Xilrath Duskryn," the drow replies, trying to compose himself.

"We can free Elandra as well," Oscorn assures him. "It will take some time."

The team gathers and begins discussing their next steps. "Natalyne," one of them suggests.

Xilrath looks wary. "We don’t talk to the leaders of the houses. How do you know them?"

Kalinar responds, "We've dealt with important people."

Xilrath explains, "We were going to make a good trade and find a place away from the houses and the way things are."

Kalinar asks, "What is your problem with the status quo?"

"For elves like us to enjoy each other's company, it’s frowned upon," Xilrath answers, hinting at the societal restrictions they face.

Oscorn interjects, "We do need some help with the markets."

Xilrath sighs, "The trade I was making was my final trade. It was going to remove myself from all of this. In the Sunken Sea, we planned to live out our lives together. Without what we lost, that’s not possible. But without her, I have nothing."

Oscorn thinks for a moment. "We need help meeting the drow."

"If that’s your goal, why are you here? This isn’t the way. There are much quicker routes to trade with the houses directly. We are on the other side of the world," Xilrath says, puzzled.

"What about the warrens?" Oscorn asks.

"They are a battleground," Xilrath replies, shaking his head.

Oscorn considers this. "If you can help us, we will help you."

Xilrath looks determined. "If you can give me Elandra, I will help you."

The team agrees to meet Xilrath's price. They ask him about the other brooches.

Xilrath nods. "You want me to give you all the politics. Being brought up as a trader, not directly from one house, I know how to negotiate. Our haul was previously going to be 2,000 gold."

They strike a deal, agreeing to Xilrath's terms. Xilrath explains the brooches: the hook signifies trade with Kilsek and Despana, while the urn signifies a completely neutral trader. Each symbol carries weight and significance in the Underdark trading world.

Czolg mutters, "Fing politics."

Finally, Oscorn approaches the statue of Elandra. With great care, he casts greater restoration. The stone peels away, and Elandra falls into Xilrath's arms. They embrace, tears of joy and relief streaming down their faces.

Xilrath explains to Elandra what has happened and the agreement they have made. Oscorn hands them a pouch of 500 gold pieces. "This is to help you get back on your feet."

Xilrath accepts it gratefully. "Here’s to getting started." They share a moment of hope amidst the perilous surroundings of the Underdark.

Kalinar, attempting to gauge any reaction, muttered, “Felch.”

Iranus's eyes widened slightly. “In the battle, I recall that name. I heard it from them when they’d attack.”

Pointing at Oscorn, he continued, “I know the warrens you speak of. Asperdis has had control of the warrens for maybe a century now."

Oscorn listened intently as Iranus elaborated. "The warrens are a winding labyrinth, rumored to hold treasures. Nobody truly knows. They tell stories of the times when folks like these two,” he gestured to Xilrath and Elandra, “when it was a battle between the troglodytes and the bugbears. The cavern was said to contain riches and artifacts. The bugbears believed the warrens were their ancestral homes, a place promised to them by their gods. They would stop at nothing to claim it. The elves looked for ways to end the conflict, but it was difficult. Anything we did seemed to worsen the animosity between the bugbears and troglodytes.”

“The kuo-toa had their own agenda and tried to intervene,” Iranus added. “Their sanity is often questioned. Many attempts were made to mediate, but nothing came of it. Centuries passed, and the battles continued. The belief was strong that this way of life would remain. Then Asperdis arrived. Through power and perhaps corruption, he enslaved both races and used them to control the warrens.”

Oscorn nodded, intrigued. “But Asperdis is a completely different story. As you know, very few people have seen him. Most of his dealings are conducted through his main trader. I’m not sure of her name. Anything going down to the vault or coming from the vault goes through the warrens. He tends to keep the best artifacts and items for himself. Nobody knows what he does with them, but he has the most powerful items in the Underdark.”

The two newly freed drow looked shocked. “The warrens are a trading post now? Who trades there?” Xilrath asked, incredulous.

“All of the Underdark trades there,” Iranus explained. “Anyone who has something valuable or seeks something powerful can trade there. The place has become a central hub for all kinds of commerce.”

Xilrath and Elandra exchanged looks, digesting this new information. The reality of their world had shifted drastically while they were petrified.

“Is this why you’re here?” Xilrath asked Oscorn, curiosity mingling with suspicion. “To trade in the warrens?”

Oscorn shook his head. “We seek to explore the warrens for potential trade opportunities. The artifacts there are said to be of great value, and we hope to find something worthwhile to trade.”

Xilrath considered this. “If you’re heading to the warrens for trade, you’ll need to be cautious. Asperdis’s influence is strong, and his reach is long. But if you can navigate the political and social intricacies, you might succeed.”

Xilrath sighed, “It seems my plans for a peaceful life in the Sunken Sea are further away than ever. But if it means securing valuable trade opportunities, I’m in.”

Elandra, having recovered from the initial shock, nodded in agreement. “We’ll help you. We know the warrens well, and with your help, perhaps we can secure some valuable trade deals.”
