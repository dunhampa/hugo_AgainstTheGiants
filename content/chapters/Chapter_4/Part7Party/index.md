The underdark settlement bustled with muted energy, shadows dancing along the jagged walls of the cavern. This neutral ground, alive with whispered negotiations and cautious glances, hosted travelers of all kinds. Zilrath spoke with Czolg, whose curiosity about local customs sparked a discussion.

“This is a place of trading,” Zilrath explained, her voice smooth and low. “Whether drow, duergar, hobgoblin, bugbear, the trogs, all who pass here honor Asperdes. This is neutral ground, a delicate balance none of us want to disrupt. No one dares awaken the hive. No one wants to relive the past.”

Czolg’s brow furrowed. “What happened in the past?”

Zilrath’s expression darkened, but she shook her head. “Another time, perhaps. Just know that leaving your mark here, especially if it’s flashy, can be risky. Asperdes values boldness and valuable goods, but anything that threatens his control risks upsetting the peace of the warrens.”

Silvius, ever practical, tilted his head. “But don’t folks need to eat? To trade?”

Zilrath regarded him carefully. “Trade and survival bind us. The inner workings of the warrens ensure everyone has a stake in maintaining order.”

Silvius’s lips curved into a mischievous grin. With a dramatic flourish, he conjured a shimmering doorway in the air. A magnificent mansion materialized, its glowing facade a stark contrast to the surrounding gloom.

“Well then,” Silvius declared, strumming his lute. “Let’s give them something to eat, drink, and sing about! A proper invitation is in order.”

Silvius began to sing:

Come, come, all you wanderers bold,
To a mansion where riches unfold,
Beyond the dark, where treasures gleam,
A feast awaits—a dream, a dream!
Chorus:
Enter, enter, come inside,

Where wonders and delights reside,
A banquet spread for all to see,
Before the market's strife runs free!
Verse 2:
Let the silver wine flow like a stream,
With golden fruits in every gleam,

The pasties hot, the meats divine,
A taste of luxury, so fine!
Chorus:
Enter, enter, come inside,
Where wonders and delights reside,
A banquet spread for all to see,

Before the market's strife runs free!
Bridge:
Oh, hear the call, oh, hear the sound,
The mansion's gates are open wide,
Where smiles and laughter shall abound,
And joy will be our only guide.

Chorus:
Enter, enter, come inside,
Where wonders and delights reside,
A banquet spread for all to see,
Before the market's strife runs free!
Outro:

So gather 'round, and join in cheer,
For the feast and revels, drawing near,
Before the market takes its toll,
Come and feast—let joy be whole!
(Instrumental flourish to close the invitation)
Let the magic of the mansion draw you in, where all are welcome before the bustling market begins!


Kalinar, a boisterous figure with a booming voice, clapped his hands. “Come eat! Food! Food!” he bellowed, his enthusiasm echoing through the cavern.

A pair of bugbear guards, Vorg and another unnamed companion, hesitated at the mansion’s threshold. “We cannot leave our post,” Vorg grumbled. “We’ve worked too hard to make it out of the warrens.”

Kalinar approached them, his tone softening. “Check on your people, make sure all is secure. Then come join us. A moment of peace won’t undo your efforts.”

Silvius’s lute rang out, the melody weaving through the cavern like an enchantment. The lyrics were an open invitation, promising warmth, camaraderie, and a feast unlike any other. Gradually, the wary denizens of the warrens emerged from the shadows. Drow, duergar, hobgoblins, and even a few skittering kuo-toa crept toward the glowing doorway.

Inside the mansion, the air was filled with laughter and the scent of rich, exotic dishes. Plates piled high with meats, fruits, and bread circulated the room, while goblets of glowing wine flowed freely. Silvius played his lute at the head of the hall, his voice a beacon of joy and reassurance.

The peace was soon disrupted by a rowdy group of hobgoblins who had caused trouble earlier. Their drunken antics escalated, drawing annoyed glances from other guests. Oscorn, ever vigilant, kept a close eye on them. “These six are going to cause trouble,” he warned the group.

When diplomacy failed, Oscorn cast Hold Person, freezing two of the hobgoblins in place. Kalinar followed with a spell of Confusion, causing disarray among the rest. Czolg, sensing their fear, stepped forward with an imposing glare. “Leave now, or you’ll regret it.”

One of the hobgoblins, confused and panicked, turned on his unconscious companion and struck him with a blade. The group froze as they realized the blow might have been fatal. Another hobgoblin fled the scene, leaving chaos in his wake.

Silvius acted quickly, healing the injured hobgoblin while dragging him toward the door. Kalinar teleported another outside using Dimension Door, while Fennuris and Oscorn worked together to haul the others out. The remaining hobgoblins resisted, but Czolg’s sheer strength subdued them long enough to expel them from the mansion.

Outside, bugbear guards approached, their faces grim. “This is unacceptable,” one growled. “Do you know what will happen if this gets out?”

“I like you guys, but this has to be reported,” another warned. Fenuris stepped closer, calm but firm. “What if we report it the right way?”

The bugbear sighed. “It’s not my decision,” he muttered before running off to fetch their leader. The group exchanged uneasy glances, aware that the peace of the warrens was hanging by a thread.

As calm returned, Silvius played a softer tune, attempting to soothe the lingering tension. Zilrath, standing nearby, watched with an inscrutable expression. “You’ve brought unity to this place, but unity doesn’t come without risk,” she said quietly.

Silvius nodded. “It'll be fine. We want to make a statement. We want to be known. Let's see who shows up.”

With the hobgoblins gone and the bugbears preparing their report, the team remained vigilant, knowing that their actions had set events in motion that could shape their fate.
