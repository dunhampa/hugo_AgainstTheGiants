The underdark settlement bustled with muted energy, shadows dancing along the jagged walls of the cavern. This neutral ground, alive with whispered negotiations and cautious glances, hosted travelers of all kinds. Zilrath spoke with Czolg, whose curiosity about local customs sparked a discussion.

“This is a place of trading,” Zilrath explained, her voice smooth and low. “Whether drow, duergar, hobgoblin, bugbear, the trogs, all who pass here honor Asperdes. This is neutral ground, a delicate balance none of us want to disrupt. No one dares awaken the hive. No one wants to relive the past.”

Czolg’s brow furrowed. “What happened in the past?”

Zilrath’s expression darkened, but she shook her head. “Another time, perhaps. Just know that leaving your mark here, especially if it’s flashy, can be risky. Asperdes values boldness and valuable goods, but anything that threatens his control risks upsetting the peace of the warrens.”

Silvius, ever practical, tilted his head. “But don’t folks need to eat? To trade?”

Zilrath regarded him carefully. “Trade and survival bind us. The inner workings of the warrens ensure everyone has a stake in maintaining order.”

Silvius’s lips curved into a mischievous grin. With a dramatic flourish, he conjured a shimmering doorway in the air. A magnificent mansion materialized, its glowing facade a stark contrast to the surrounding gloom.

“Well then,” Silvius declared, strumming his lute. “Let’s give them something to eat, drink, and sing about! A proper invitation is in order.”

Silvius began to sing:

Come, come, all you wanderers bold,
To a mansion where riches unfold,
Beyond the dark, where treasures gleam,
A feast awaits—a dream, a dream!
Chorus:
Enter, enter, come inside,

Where wonders and delights reside,
A banquet spread for all to see,
Before the market's strife runs free!
Verse 2:
Let the silver wine flow like a stream,
With golden fruits in every gleam,

The pasties hot, the meats divine,
A taste of luxury, so fine!
Chorus:
Enter, enter, come inside,
Where wonders and delights reside,
A banquet spread for all to see,

Before the market's strife runs free!
Bridge:
Oh, hear the call, oh, hear the sound,
The mansion's gates are open wide,
Where smiles and laughter shall abound,
And joy will be our only guide.

Chorus:
Enter, enter, come inside,
Where wonders and delights reside,
A banquet spread for all to see,
Before the market's strife runs free!
Outro:

So gather 'round, and join in cheer,
For the feast and revels, drawing near,
Before the market takes its toll,
Come and feast—let joy be whole!
(Instrumental flourish to close the invitation)
Let the magic of the mansion draw you in, where all are welcome before the bustling market begins!

Kalinar, a boisterous figure with a booming voice, clapped his hands. “Come eat! Food! Food!” he bellowed, his enthusiasm echoing through the cavern.

A pair of bugbear guards, Vorg and another unnamed companion, hesitated at the mansion’s threshold. “We cannot leave our post,” Vorg grumbled. “We’ve worked too hard to make it out of the warrens.”

Kalinar approached them, his tone softening. “Check on your people, make sure all is secure. Then come join us. A moment of peace won’t undo your efforts.”

Silvius’s lute rang out, the melody weaving through the cavern like an enchantment. The lyrics were an open invitation, promising warmth, camaraderie, and a feast unlike any other. Gradually, the wary denizens of the warrens emerged from the shadows. Drow, duergar, hobgoblins, and even a few skittering kuo-toa crept toward the glowing doorway.

Inside the mansion, the air was filled with laughter and the scent of rich, exotic dishes. Plates piled high with meats, fruits, and bread circulated the room, while goblets of glowing wine flowed freely. Silvius played his lute at the head of the hall, his voice a beacon of joy and reassurance.

The peace was soon disrupted by a rowdy group of hobgoblins who had caused trouble earlier. Their drunken antics escalated, drawing annoyed glances from other guests. Oscorn, ever vigilant, kept a close eye on them. “These six are going to cause trouble,” he warned the group.

When diplomacy failed, Oscorn cast Hold Person, freezing two of the hobgoblins in place. Kalinar followed with a spell of Confusion, causing disarray among the rest. Czolg, sensing their fear, stepped forward with an imposing glare. “Leave now, or you’ll regret it.”

One of the hobgoblins, confused and panicked, turned on his unconscious companion and struck him with a blade. The group froze as they realized the blow might have been fatal. Another hobgoblin fled the scene, leaving chaos in his wake.

Silvius acted quickly, healing the injured hobgoblin while dragging him toward the door. Kalinar teleported another outside using Dimension Door, while Fennuris and Oscorn worked together to haul the others out. The remaining hobgoblins resisted, but Czolg’s sheer strength subdued them long enough to expel them from the mansion.

Outside, bugbear guards approached, their faces grim. “This is unacceptable,” one growled. “Do you know what will happen if this gets out?”

“I like you guys, but this has to be reported,” another warned. Fenuris stepped closer, calm but firm. “What if we report it the right way?”

The bugbear sighed. “It’s not my decision,” he muttered before running off to fetch their leader. The group exchanged uneasy glances, aware that the peace of the warrens was hanging by a thread.

As calm returned, Silvius played a softer tune, attempting to soothe the lingering tension. Zilrath, standing nearby, watched with an inscrutable expression. “You’ve brought unity to this place, but unity doesn’t come without risk,” she said quietly.

Silvius nodded. “It'll be fine. We want to make a statement. We want to be known. Let's see who shows up.”

With the hobgoblins gone and the bugbears preparing their report, the team remained vigilant, knowing that their actions had set events in motion that could shape their fate.

As the door to Silvius’ magical mansion disappeared into the void, Frog stood rooted in place, eyes wide with wonder. “Is it gone?” Frog asked cautiously.

Silvius glanced back at the empty space where the door had been, his confusion quickly replaced by amusement. “…Yeah,” he said with a smirk, looking back and forth between Frog and the void.

Kalinar wasted no time. “What do you know about who’s trustworthy around here?” he asked, his tone probing.

Frog’s voice dropped conspiratorially. “You never know what the trolls are going to do.”

Kalinar nodded thoughtfully. “Not a fan of the ax chuckers, then?”

Frog shook his head in agreement. “And we never trust the Trogs.”

Before more could be said, Vrek returned with a small entourage, gesturing to a striking figure at the center. “This is the group, Priestess,” he announced.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "right" imagePath = "/img/C4 Dana.JPG" Capition = "The Priestess"  width = "60%" >}}

A pale-skinned, beautifully adorned drow priestess stepped forward. Her elegant attire lacked the spider motifs typical of other drow priestesses, marking her as someone distinct. As she approached, her sharp eyes scanned the group. “Why the disturbance?” she demanded. “How did things get out of control?”

Silvius stepped forward, hands open in a gesture of innocence. “Things were out of control, and then they weren’t,” he said with a disarming smile.

Kalinar added, “We threw a celebration in honor of Asperdes. We’re new here from the surface and wanted to gain the right people’s attention.”

The priestess arched an eyebrow. “I would expect more from those seeking my attention. And yet your explanation doesn’t add up. I’ve dealt with swindlers and liars before. I heard there was a party and a room. Yet, I see no such room. Where is it?”

Silvius gestured vaguely. “It’s gone now.”

“Bring it back,” the priestess commanded, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Oscorn interjected, “You can’t consistently cast that kind of magic.…”

Begrudgingly, Silvius gave a small performance, weaving a brief song that culminated in the return of the mansion’s doorway. The priestess’ gaze lingered on the entryway before she snapped, “Get these idiots out of here,” motioning toward the hobgoblins.

Kalinar attempted to smooth things over. “These were the gifts we were trying to bestow.”

Inside, the mansion was clearly in disarray, with servants scrambling to clean up the remnants of the chaotic feast. Silvius directed the staff to fetch drinks and samples, doing his best to salvage the situation.

The priestess turned to her guards. “You two, guard the door. And this door stays open,” she ordered in Undercommon. Then, addressing the group, she asked, “May we sit?”

Servants brought out wine and hors d’oeuvres as the priestess appraised the adventurers. “You all seem very out of place,” she remarked.

Silvius leaned forward with a smile. “The most out-of-place places do the best business.”

Zilrath subtly motioned to Silvius and Oscorn, and understanding dawned. This priestess was Dana, Asperdes’ second-in-command.

Dana’s eyes narrowed as she studied the group. “Some of you look like traders. Some of you, I’ve seen before,” she said, gesturing toward Tilandra. “And some of you don’t look like traders at all, which benefits me.”

“How does that help you?” Oscorn asked.

“What services do you need from those who don’t look like traders?” Kalinar added.

Dana’s lips curved into a faint smile. “Funny you mention services. We have a problem.”

Kalinar, ever bold, quipped, “I know it’s not polite to bring up religion on a first date, but Priestess of…?”

Dana’s smile didn’t waver. “I separated myself from the houses long ago. I still worship the queen, but I’m aligned to the warrens, not a house. It has served me greatly—I’m safer here than anywhere.”

“Seems like a safe space,” Silvius mused.

Dana’s eyes sparkled with an unreadable emotion. “You have no idea. Now, let’s get to business. Nobody comes down here and makes a spectacle without wanting something.”

Kalinar explained, “We’re looking to establish connections with trade. The war on the surface, the chaos with the giants… There’s an opportunity to open new channels.”

“Two types of trade,” Silvius added. “Normal… and more special items.”

Dana’s gaze sharpened. “Would you say they’re wondrous items?”

“We’d love to trade some,” Kalinar confirmed.

Dana nodded. “We can trade. And if you help us with one favor, we’ll overlook this incident.”

Kalinar answered immediately. “Yes.”

Dana leaned forward. “It’s simple. There’s a slug causing trouble. It’s eaten some bugbears, and it’s becoming an issue. But between the trogs and others, there’s resistance to killing it. We need to get it out without harming it.”

Oscorn frowned. “Why don’t they want it killed?”

Dana shrugged. “They believe it’s part of the land’s original essence. And we don’t want the political fallout.”

“What does the slug eat?” Oscorn asked.

Dana outlined the plan. “Get it to the north cavern and out the hallway. Once it’s out, we hope it will just move along. Someone will guide you in eight hours. Who’s responsible for all this?”

All fingers pointed at Silvius. The bard raised a hand sheepishly. “That would be me.”

Dana smirked. “You may have to show me this…” She swept out of the room, leaving the group to prepare for what lay ahead.

As they settled in, Zilrath shared her concerns. “Dana’s worry about the trogs is unusual. It suggests instability.”

Kalinar nodded. “This situation doesn’t sit right. Have you met Dana before?”

“Yes, for trading,” Zilrath admitted. “But her secrecy about Asperdes is troubling. Some say he doesn’t exist. And the items procured through Dana… they disappear. It’s a perfect system to hide something significant.”

Fennuris grinned. “So you’re saying there’s a cave of wonders?”

Zilrath’s expression darkened. “Perhaps. But for most of us, this is survival. The black market here is vast. You’ve piqued her interest, which could be dangerous.”

Kalinar’s tone turned speculative. “What if Asperdes is the slug?”

Zilrath shrugged. “What do you suggest?”

The group agreed to rest, finding solace in the bustling activity of the warrens as their name spread through whispered conversations. The morning would bring their encounter with the mysterious slug—and perhaps answers to deeper mysteries.

The bugbears returned, their expressions expectant. “What do you want to do?” one asked.

Kalinar’s voice was firm. “Take us to the slug.”

The team set out, following the bugbears through the warrens. Along the way, they passed groups of kobolds and Drow. The kobolds called out, “Hey, great party!” while the drow offered subtle nods of acknowledgment. The mood was a mixture of curiosity and unease as the team moved deeper into the labyrinthine tunnels.

Eventually, they reached a massive hallway. One of the bugbears pointed toward a northern passage. “It’s up there.”

Kalinar glanced around. “Why is it here? How long has it been around?”

The bugbear shrugged. “This area empties out between markets. Sometimes when it’s quiet, the slug moves in to digest a meal. But lately, it’s been staying longer. As we’ve gotten closer, bugbears started disappearing. We’ve seen trails of slime, and… don’t tell anyone, but the trolls are worried about it. In a weird way.”

Kalinar raised an eyebrow. “The trolls? Don’t they kind of rule down here?”

“They do,” the bugbear admitted. “That’s why it’s strange. They’re avoiding it.”

“Is it gigantic?” Kalinar asked.

“They can get big,” the bugbear replied ominously.

As they approached, Kalinar and Silvius spotted a Hyrocross sphinx perched high above, watching silently. “What’s the deal with the sphinx?” Kalinar asked.

Vrek, one of the bugbears, muttered, “Drow stuff.”

Frog added in a whisper, “Some say it’s Dana’s.”

“Shut up,” Vrek snapped. “It’s dangerous down here. Clearing it out would be a nightmare. Maybe they don’t want it cleared.”

The sphinx’s gaze shifted to Silvius’ pegasus, its predatory intent unmistakable.

Oscorn frowned. “Does it like bugbears?”

The bugbear huffed. “People keep saying ‘bugbear,’ but we’re just the ones who go through this path. That’s why we’re the ones disappearing.”

As they continued, Oscorn noticed slime on the ground. It clung to the lower areas, with none higher up on the walls. Fennuris crouched to examine the trail, carefully tracking the slug’s movements.

The path ended at a solid wall. Fennuris nocked a flaming arrow and fired it upward. The arrow bounced around before landing on the ground, revealing a glistening slug eye peering out from the shadows.

“There it is,” Fennuris said, positioning herself.

{{<imageToClickGlobal imgPosition = "left" imagePath = "/img/C4 Slug.JPG" Capition = "The slug"  width = "60%" >}}

Kalinar stepped forward cautiously, his voice calm. “Easy… easy…” he said, attempting to charm the creature. He seemed to be successful and noticed a softening in the massive slugs protruding eyes.

Oscorn moved to flank the slug, while Silvius attempted a polymorph spell. The magic fizzled, leaving the slug unharmed but now visibly irritated.

The slug lashed out, striking Kalinar. He staggered, acid and bludgeoning damage tearing into him. A cold retaliation from his magical protection struck back at the creature.

Oscorn hurled a rock to provoke the slug, but his aim was off, nearly hitting the pegasus. Silvius quickly conjured an illusory group of bugbears. The fake bugbears were robust, their muscular and fatty forms could be best described as marbled, glistening with sweat and exuding a pungent musk that could appeal to the slug’s senses.

Aranis, the elf, sprinted forward. “We need to lead it this way!” he shouted. A bugbear briefly peeked out from cover but quickly hid again as the slug’s attention shifted.

The slug lurched toward the illusion, but then turning its attention to the sprinting elf, the slug spit a glob of acid. The projectile struck Aranis, who melted him into a pile of nothing before anyone could react.

Kalinar, Fennuris, and Oscorn dodged to the north as the slug advanced. The pegasus launched itself 50 feet into the air, while Silvius retreated further back, maintaining the illusion. The slug’s massive body oozed forward, drawn by the fake bugbears crawling ahead.

Suddenly, the sphinxes dove from their perch, tearing the pegasus apart before retreating to their heights. Silvius felt sorry for his conjured steed but stayed focused on the bugbear illusion.

With Kalinar, Oscorn, Fennuris, and the illusory bugbears leading the slug north, the team maintained hope. The task was fraught with danger and loss, but their resolve remained steadfast. They would complete Dana’s request.

Kalinar sprinted north, weaving through the dark cavern as the slug’s massive bulk oozed forward, its eyestalks wobbling excitedly in pursuit of the bugbears. He passed his teammates disappearing into the widening hallway ahead.

Czolg  hesitated for a moment, observing the slick ground beneath him. He cautiously approached the slug from behind, mindful of the slime coating the tunnel floor. He could feel the treacherous slickness under his boots as he edged forward.

Fennuris darted after Kalinar, determined to stay ahead of the lumbering creature. Meanwhile, Silvius trailed behind the slug, concentrating on his illusionary bugbears, their sweaty forms continuing to tempt the creature forward.

The slug lurched toward the mirage, entirely fixated, its massive form undulating down the hall. As the team ran, Silvius noticed the sphinxes had left their perches, gliding silently ahead, settling at a junction down the hallway.

The tunnel widened as Kalinar and Fennuris surged forward. Czolg continued to shadow the slug, sliding effortlessly as the slime turned the ground into an impromptu surfboard. He easily kept his balance, riding the slick path with unexpected finesse.

Fennuris studied the slug’s behavior, attempting to discern its true intent. Was it following the illusion, or was it simply tracking the vibrations of their movement? Her observations remained inconclusive.
The team pressed forward, their movements synchronized. Kalinar reached a bend in the tunnel and swiftly pressed himself against the wall, waiting and watching. Silvius kept his illusion moving steadily ahead while Oscorn mirrored Kalinar’s tactics, keeping to the opposite wall and slowly making his way back toward the market.

The slug dug deep, its pace increasing as it pursued the imaginary bugbears. Silvius, maintaining control, deftly guided the illusion further down the cavern. Kalinar took note of the path ahead—this was no well-traveled route. The ground was undisturbed, hinting that few, if any, ventured here regularly.

Silvius pushed the bugbear illusion further, extending their lead until he reached his limit. The slug hesitated, its eyestalks shifting as confusion set in. Seizing the opportunity, Silvius sent a quick message to Kalinar, instructing him to return.

For a tense moment, the slug remained still, its body writhing with uncertainty. Then, with an urgent lunge, it charged down the hallway after its elusive meal. Kalinar slipped past the slug, pressing against the cavern wall before sprinting back to the rest of the team.

As the slug reached the end of the illusion’s path, Silvius brought the mirage to a grand finale. The bugbears collapsed into a putrid, steaming puddle, a grotesque pile of melting flesh. The slug, overcome with excitement, lunged at the remains, eagerly consuming the nonexistent feast.

Kalinar rejoined the group, panting. “What do we do if it comes back?”

The slug flailed about, its frustration evident as it searched in vain for its meal. For nearly a minute, it writhed in desperation before settling into a sluggish, disoriented stupor.

A solution presented itself: a salt fountain—like a cascading chocolate fountain, but composed of glistening, coarse salt—was cast before the slug’s passage. The reaction was immediate. The slug recoiled, its body convulsing as it retreated, trapped within the confines of the narrow tunnel.

Confident that the creature was contained, the team made their way back to the warrens. Vrek and Grog awaited them, their expressions wary.

Silvius wasted no time. “The slug is sealed in. The salt should keep it at bay.”

Vrek grunted in approval before glancing at the remains of Aranis. “And what do we do about this?”

Silvius sighed. “Sweep him up, I suppose.”

The journey back to the warrens was quiet. As they entered the market, the drow eyed them curiously. One finally stepped forward. “Where is Aranis?”

Silvius answered bluntly. “Dead. He ran into a slug.”

The drow merely nodded, accepting the news without emotion.

Summoning his pegasus once more, Silvius turned his attention to Dana. The market had grown busier in their absence, more traders and merchants gathering.

Dana’s gaze met his. “My pets help keep the peace,” she remarked.

Silvius gave a knowing nod. “So do mine. But if they’re taking up too much space—are there stables?”

Dana scoffed. “Do you take me for a fool?”

Kalinar stepped forward. “We helped you here.”

Dana’s expression remained unreadable. “If you want this to work, you obey our rules.”

Silvius inclined his head. “We don’t know your rules. But we will obey.”

Dana’s lips curved into a faint smile. “We appreciate what you’ve done. It has saved us time. The opening seems secure, though you did lose a friend. But that’s how things work in the warrens. The market should be open soon. Is there anything you seek? Anything you’re willing to part with?”

Silvius glanced at his companions. Kalinar was the first to speak. “Are any of the houses particularly represented?”

Czolg, ever pragmatic, added, “I’m searching for a fine magical shield, if you know where one is.”
Silvius nodded. “Something to protect myself better wouldn’t hurt.”

Dana gestured toward the market. “The stalls will have some interesting items, but if you want something high-end, you come through me. We don’t always find such powerful people passing through.”
With that, she turned and strode away, disappearing into the maze of the warrens.

Silvius smirked. “If you need a room, you know where to find one…”

Dana’s laughter echoed as she vanished into the crowd, leaving the group to contemplate their next move in the ever-shifting underworld of the warrens.
