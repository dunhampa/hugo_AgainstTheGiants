Operation Trundle Wagon gathered in a quiet alcove of the warrens, their voices hushed but eager as they discussed their trading prospects. With the underdark market before them, they carefully laid out their goods, pooling their items to maximize their trade potential. Silvius examined his collection, which included a Potion of Poison, a Potion of Fire Giant Mind Control, a Potion of Diminution, a +1 Shortsword, and a Scroll of Heat Metal. Czolg had a Potion of Heroism, while Oscorn carried a Scroll of Protection Against Undead. Kalinar contributed two spell scrolls, one of Tongues and another of Tasha’s Hideous Laughter. Fenurris had nothing to trade, but their most prized possession was a Vorpal Scimitar, an item so rare and valuable that they speculated it could be their key to gaining an audience with Asperdis himself.

After securing their wares, the group discussed what they sought in return. Oscorn and Czolg both aimed to acquire better shields to enhance their defenses. Silvius hoped to find Mithril Half Plate armor to improve his protection while maintaining his mobility. Kalinar and Fenurris had no particular needs but remained open to any unique or powerful items they might come across in the market. Though focused on their primary needs, everyone remained interested in acquiring items of particular use or intrigue.

Before heading into the market, Czolg took a moment to speak with Xilrath and Talindra about the Great City of the drow.

“It’s the city of the drow. The home of our people,” Xilrath explained. “Most worship Lolth. The battle between the houses stems from the belief that one should rule over all, but not everyone agrees on which house that should be.”

Silvius raised an eyebrow. “And what do you believe?”

Talindra’s expression was unreadable, but Xilrath answered plainly. “We want out. To escape the politics and the bloodshed. We just want to live. Trade might be our way out. That, and…” she hesitated. “Once, we ran into a beholder.”

Czolg, ever curious, leaned forward. “And the vault? What’s in it?”

The two drow exchanged a glance before stepping away for a whispered conversation. When they returned, Xilrath’s expression was serious. “The vault isn’t a treasure hoard—it’s the drow’s domain. The Great City itself. It’s more than just a city; it holds different academies, trading hubs, and mining operations. The houses protect the Fane of Lolth, where the queen resides.”

“How far are we from the vault?” Czolg asked.

“You’re about a third of the way there,” Xilrath replied. “The checkpoint you passed through… not everyone makes it through that.”

Kalinar smirked. “One step at a time, and a little luck.”

Xilrath chuckled. “Luck indeed. Few make it this far unscathed.”

Czolg pressed further. “We heard there’s a forge in the vault. Any details?”

Xilrath nodded. “Of course. The city forges weapons to arm its defenders. Quality work.”

The market was a lively place, filled with an assortment of traders and vendors, each offering something different. The group moved through the bustling stalls, taking in the sights and smells of the underground commerce.

At the orc’s stall, Silvius eyed the displayed weapons. “Got anything powerful or unusual?” he asked.

Umak Goz, the burly orc vendor, chuckled. “Most of what I have is standard, but…” He leaned in conspiratorially. “I do have something fun. Real and fake manacles.”

Silvius grinned. “I like options. I’ll take both.”

Czolg and Oscorn inquired about shields, and Umak promised to check his storage. “Come back tomorrow. I’ll have something for you.”

Next, they visited Glubglub, the enthusiastic kuo-toa merchant selling hunting and fishing gear. Silvius, ever curious, asked, “I haven’t seen much water around here. Is there really fishing?”

“Oh yes!” Glubglub beamed. “Plenty of fishing if you know where to look. Hunting, too.”

Silvius pressed further. “Any good spots between here and the Great City?”

Glubglub nodded excitedly. “The barge isn’t what it used to be, but east and west of here, there are still good spots. Most go by boat.” His eyes glinted with warning. “You must be careful. The river flows to the Sunless Sea. If you’re not careful, you’ll end up there.”

Silvius frowned. “The surface ocean?”

Glubglub shook his head. “Different one. The Sunless Sea. It’ll carry you away. Best to stay on land.”

At Stanmore’s Emporium, the eccentric human merchant greeted them with enthusiasm. “This is a sight to see!”

Silvius chuckled. “I agree.”

Stanmore’s wares included pocket watches, perfumes, intricate boxes, and a collection of sparkling rocks. He gestured proudly. “Ah, my best seller—flashbangs.”

Silvius wasted no time. “I’ll take all six.”

As they finalized their trade, Stanmore grinned. “Why pay more? Visit Stanmore’s!”

Silvius laughed and added, “Why pay more? Check out Stanmore! Wares of wonder, spells of lore! From potions deep to trinkets grand, finest goods in all the land!”

Stanmore clapped along, delighted. “Well said, traveler!”

At the apothecary stall, Falleron the drow inspected Silvius’ Potion of Diminution with wide eyes. “Where did you get this?”

Kalinar remained vague. “We’ve been many places.”

Falleron’s voice lowered. “Are you willing to part with it?”

Silvius nodded. “Apples to apples.”

Falleron led them to a back room, presenting various potions. “Antitoxins, climbing potions, gaseous form, alchemist’s fire…”

Oscorn picked up the antitoxins. “These could be useful.”

After a brief negotiation, the team secured potions of greater healing and various supplies.

Their final stop was the book stall, run by a drow trader with a pin of bone, marking her as a trader from House Eclavdra—the house that had sent giants to the surface.

Oscorn perused her collection. “Anything on politics or history?”

She retrieved a book. “A heritage book on Elserves and Everhate.”

Oscorn handed over his parchment in trade. “I’ll take it.”

Silvius, always one for stories, inquired, “Can I trade a fiction book for a fiction book?”

The trader smiled. “Of course.”

Silvius exchanged a copy of Tales of the Giants for a drow novel, then ordered vials of glowing, invisible, and stink ink along with a fine quill.
Operation Trundle Wagon gathered their things and made their way toward the tool vendor, weaving through the bustling market. The vendor, a female drow, stood at her stall, engaged in a casual conversation with another drow. She gave the group a brief wave before returning to her discussion about the weather.

Silvius ran his fingers over the simple hand tools displayed on the shelves. He picked one up, turning it over in his hands. "This has seen some work. What are these for?"

The drow vendor glanced at him. "Mining or construction."

Silvius nodded thoughtfully. "What’s good to mine down here?"

The vendor shrugged. "Everything is underground. Around here? Nothing in particular. What are you looking for?"

Silvius exchanged a glance with Czolg, who spoke up. "Shadowscar is looking for some tools."

Czolg scanned the wares. "Got any smith’s tools?"

The drow vendor shook her head. "Not this time. Only regular hammers."

Czolg frowned. "This is all you got?"

The drow gave him a puzzled look. "Yes. Unfortunately, we didn’t bring much this time."

Fennuris noticed Shadowscar shifting slightly closer to him. The rogue’s hood was up, his head lowered. Shadowscar caught Fennuris' gaze and subtly shook his head.

"Looks like nothing here. Let’s move on," Fennuris said.

The vendor inclined her head. "Thanks for your business. Sorry we couldn’t help you today."

As they left, Fennuris discreetly pulled Shadowscar aside. "You good?"

Shadowscar exhaled slowly. "They don’t sell tools. They sell slaves. I think they know me, but I can’t remember. I just didn’t want to be seen."

Fennuris frowned. "Do we need to keep an eye on them?"

Shadowscar gave a grim nod. "They’re not moral people. They deal in humanoids."

The team moved on to meet Dana, who welcomed them warmly.

Silvius praised the market. "I must say, this place is impressively fair, peaceful, and well-organized."

Dana smiled, clearly pleased. "We take pride in our work here. It pleases the master."

Silvius leaned forward. "Is there any way we could help in the caves? We took care of the gigantic slug, after all. Or maybe you know of any lost treasure?"

Dana shook her head. "Not much goes missing. We keep tight inventory."

Silvius pulled out the +1 shortsword, and Dana, in turn, produced a pristine white glove. "What is it that you seek?" she asked.

Silvius repeated their requests for shields and armor. Dana examined the weapon and scoffed. "It’s nice, but not worthy of what I have brought."

Kalinar smirked. "Then let’s raise the stakes." He pulled out the vorpal scimitar.

Dana’s eyes widened. She ran her fingers reverently over the blade, then withdrew her hand. "This… this is why we created this place. Rare, invaluable." She glanced around and gestured for them to put it away. "Now, do we start from the top or the bottom?"

"Bottom," Silvius answered.

Dana waved a hand, and an illusory image materialized, rotating in the air.

Armor of the Fallen – A chain shirt that appeared to be made from bones and hide. Wearing this armor allows someone to raise and speak with the dead.

Sentinel Shield – A shield that grants advantage on initiative rolls and perception checks, heightening the wielder’s awareness.

Spiked Armor – A set of armor covered in menacing spikes, allowing the wearer to damage attackers when grappling them and also providing immunity to fear effects and calming those who are out of control.

Arrow Catching Shield – This shield grants a bonus to AC and has the ability to draw incoming ranged attacks away from nearby allies.

Living Armor – A sinister black set of ring mail held together with sinew, which grants resistance to poison, psychic, and necrotic damage. However, it binds to the wearer, making it nearly impossible to remove.

Animated Shield – A magical shield that, when commanded, hovers around the user and provides its protective benefits without needing to be held.

Dana offered any one item in exchange for the scimitar.

Kalinar nodded. "I could hold onto this sword—it doesn’t mess around. But I’d trade for the Animated Shield, the Arrow Catching Shield, and the Spiked Armor."

Dana’s expression tightened. "I understand its value, but I can’t trade one for three."

Kalinar considered. "What if we add this bag of holding? It only holds treasure."

Oscorn smirked. "It’s unique because it’s worse."

Silvius launched into an elaborate pitch about its merits, but Dana remained unimpressed. "Throw in the +1 sword, and it’s a deal."

Kalinar sighed. "I respect your inventory and expertise, but we seem unprepared to make a deal today. You’ll have to excuse us."

Dana nodded, unfazed. "I would love to have that item. You know where to find me if you wish to trade."

Silvius bowed slightly. "Thank you, Dana. We will think on it."

Hungry, the team wandered to Glugulfin’s Mergle Burg, a kuo-toa food stall where deep-fried cave bats were on the menu.

As they ate, Oscorn recounted what he saw through his magical eye:

North of the sphinx: A loop leading northwest. Within, there were over fifty undead, including larger ones.

East of the sphinx: A pond with two cave entrances leading to an interconnected system filled with more than a hundred bugbears and troglodytes. Several well-armed bugbears, including two massive leaders, were stationed there.

Mushroom Cavern: A cavern filled with fluorescent fungi, leading into troll-infested corridors. Among them, a particularly large troll dressed in decorative attire.

Gargoyles: At least fifteen to twenty gargoyles lurking on ledges, watching everything silently.

Trog Corridors: Dozens of trogs crammed into narrow corridors, likely a defensive stronghold.

Bugbear Encampments: Divided into military quarters and family dwellings. One chamber housed over a hundred bugbears, including young and non-combatants. Several heavily armored warriors occupied separate rooms.

Zombies: More signs of the undead, adding to the eerie feeling of the northern caves.

As they finished their meal, they decided to rest, contemplating their next move against the dangers lurking in the warrens.

Operation Trundle Wagon gathered once more, deliberating on their next steps. They had heard whispers of the twin passageways leading to Asperdis, the elusive lich who ruled the warrens from the shadows. If they wanted to make contact, they needed a plan. The consensus was clear: Dana was their best bet for an introduction.

As they returned to the camp they noticed the entrance to the two caves they heard leads to Asperdis, a wary drow guard stood watch, his gaze appraising the adventurers with quiet scrutiny.

Czolg stepped forward. "We heard about these caves. Know anything about them?"

The guard scoffed. "It's the reason I'm here. You don't just go and talk to the master. Most that do… don’t come back."

Czolg smirked. "So do I schedule an appointment, or is there a sign-up sheet?"

The guard exhaled sharply, somewhere between a laugh and a sigh. "Not with me. Nobody really asks to see him. Best to speak with Dana. Do you know her?"

Czolg nodded. "Yeah, we know Dana."

"Then I’d start there," the guard replied. "If you really want to see him."

Czolg peered down the two passageways. "Do these caves connect? What’s the difference?"

"Both lead down to where he... takes his time."

"Doing what, exactly?"

"Running all that you see. Even though he’s not seen, he seems to run it all."

Czolg whistled. "Sounds powerful."

The guard inclined his head. "To turn this place into what it is? Some say he’s a god."

Kalinar chimed in. "Your god?"

The guard scoffed. "Not my god. All hail to Lolth that hails in the depths."

Czolg crossed his arms. "Can people just walk in, or—?"

The guard shrugged. "I'm not going to stop you. But everyone that enters doesn’t come out."

Silvius gave a sidelong glance to Czolg. "Maybe we should rest and check this out tomorrow, big guy."

Oscorn toyed with the idea of sending his magical eye to scout, but ultimately, they decided to return to camp.

As they made their way back, the area outside the warrens had become livelier. More merchants had set up side trades—games of chance, gambling, food stalls, and trinket vendors. The hum of underground commerce thrived in the dim glow of phosphorescent fungi.

Czolg spotted their drow contacts and strode up. "Got anything on House Despana?"

One of the drow chuckled. "Unlikely. Anything specific you're looking for?"

"We’d like to talk to the priestess chick," Czolg said bluntly.

"Of Despana?" The drow laughed. "That’s a big ask. If she passed through here, she wouldn’t be trying to get to the warrens—she’d be heading to her house. It’s not that this place is dangerous for them, but it’s safer at their own home."

"Looking for connections," Czolg pressed.

The drow nodded. "We’ll see what we can find."

The next day, they found a much longer line at the entrance. When they finally reached Dana, Silvius greeted her with his usual charm. "We don’t mean to intrude, but we’re hoping for your insight."

Dana gave a knowing smile. "You’re welcome to look around. Check back with me when you’re ready."

Silvius inclined his head. "We appreciate the hospitality and flexibility."

Their first stop was Umak’s weapon stall.

"Umak!" Silvius greeted. "How are you today? Got anything new for us?"

The orc smith chuckled. "I could only find one thing." He gestured for them to step around the table. Reaching into his chest pocket, he carefully unfolded a cloth, revealing a plain silver-plated ring.

"My mastery is in weapons and armor, and your group asks for the best. Unfortunately, my cash is spent, and my stock is low. This is what I have left. It was given to me by great traders. I haven’t tested what it does—could be a risk. But people are talking about you. What you have. What you're willing to spend. You don’t seem like the penny-pinching sort."

Silvius handed the ring to Czolg, who closed his eyes, channeling the power of his storm rune. The ring pulsed with elemental energy, aligning with the stone rune. It felt linked to an elemental plane, its power dormant but potent.

Czolg opened his eyes and shrugged. "Meh. Doesn’t look like much."

Umak blinked, surprised by Czolg’s casual dismissal.

Silvius, smirking, struck a deal. In exchange for the ring, he offered an axe head, a sword, 300 gold, and a 100-gold-value gem. As he slid the ring onto his finger, he and Umak exchanged nods of respect.

"A pleasure as always, Umak."

Kalinar, ever eager to bond with his fellow orc, struck up a conversation about Umak’s past. The smith revealed that he had been captured in a drow raid, separated from his family, and forced into servitude. Over time, he had honed his craft, blending orcish power with drow finesse.

Silvius, ever inquisitive, asked, "Think you could make barding for a pegasus?"

Umak looked skeptical. "Not something I’ve seen before. Not my expertise. But I might try."

Kalinar, more serious, inquired about the prevalence of slavery.

Umak’s expression darkened. "All the houses deal in slaves or have field drow. That’s just the way of things down here."

They moved on to the apothecary, where they were greeted by Valoneer Fondal, a drow trader with a prism pin.

Silvius decided to be direct. "We’re looking for Eclavdra. The attacks on the surface, the giants—our goal is to put a stop to it for good."

Valoneer’s expression turned calculating. "Eclavdra came through here. Hard to track."

Silvius leaned forward. "Who’s she traveling with?"

"A duergar. But pale."

Oscorn frowned. "Odd. Anyone else?"

"Ombi came through here, too."

The team shared a glance. Another piece of the puzzle.

Kalinar, meanwhile, drifted to the tool vendors, where he found high-quality lockpicks and fine craftsmanship tools. The drow vendor, Safara, smirked. "This is how I make my name in the warrens. If you’re looking for real tools, I’ve got them. If you're looking for business, we can talk elsewhere."

"Name’s Kalinar," he said, sliding a gold coin across the table. "We’ll be in touch."

Finally, Dana arrived to escort them to Asperdis. She led them down a narrow tunnel that opened into a massive chamber, at the center of which loomed a large gargoyle statue.

"Asperdis can hear you," Dana said. "I will speak for him."

Silvius stepped forward, praising the warrens for their peace and trade. He explained their true goal: to hunt down Eclavdra and stop the attacks. He also proposed an alliance to take down Brazzamel, the legendary red dragon, and split the spoils.

Dana considered, then nodded. "We will give you a year. After that, we may take action on our own."

A deal was struck. The path ahead remained uncertain, but one thing was clear—Operation Trundle Wagon had made their first major connections in the underdark.
