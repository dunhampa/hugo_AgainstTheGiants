Operation Trundle Wagon gathered in a quiet alcove of the warrens, their voices hushed but eager as they discussed their trading prospects. With the underdark market before them, they carefully laid out their goods, pooling their items to maximize their trade potential. Silvius examined his collection, which included a Potion of Poison, a Potion of Fire Giant Mind Control, a Potion of Diminution, a +1 Shortsword, and a Scroll of Heat Metal. Czolg had a Potion of Heroism, while Oscorn carried a Scroll of Protection Against Undead. Kalinar contributed two spell scrolls, one of Tongues and another of Tasha’s Hideous Laughter. Fenurris had nothing to trade, but their most prized possession was a Vorpal Scimitar, an item so rare and valuable that they speculated it could be their key to gaining an audience with Asperdis himself.

After securing their wares, the group discussed what they sought in return. Oscorn and Czolg both aimed to acquire better shields to enhance their defenses. Silvius hoped to find Mithril Half Plate armor to improve his protection while maintaining his mobility. Kalinar and Fenurris had no particular needs but remained open to any unique or powerful items they might come across in the market. Though focused on their primary needs, everyone remained interested in acquiring items of particular use or intrigue.

Before heading into the market, Czolg took a moment to speak with Xilrath and Talindra about the Great City of the drow.

“It’s the city of the drow. The home of our people,” Xilrath explained. “Most worship Lolth. The battle between the houses stems from the belief that one should rule over all, but not everyone agrees on which house that should be.”

Silvius raised an eyebrow. “And what do you believe?”

Talindra’s expression was unreadable, but Xilrath answered plainly. “We want out. To escape the politics and the bloodshed. We just want to live. Trade might be our way out. That, and…” she hesitated. “Once, we ran into a beholder.”

Czolg, ever curious, leaned forward. “And the vault? What’s in it?”

The two drow exchanged a glance before stepping away for a whispered conversation. When they returned, Xilrath’s expression was serious. “The vault isn’t a treasure hoard—it’s the drow’s domain. The Great City itself. It’s more than just a city; it holds different academies, trading hubs, and mining operations. The houses protect the Fane of Lolth, where the queen resides.”

“How far are we from the vault?” Czolg asked.

“You’re about a third of the way there,” Xilrath replied. “The checkpoint you passed through… not everyone makes it through that.”

Kalinar smirked. “One step at a time, and a little luck.”

Xilrath chuckled. “Luck indeed. Few make it this far unscathed.”

Czolg pressed further. “We heard there’s a forge in the vault. Any details?”

Xilrath nodded. “Of course. The city forges weapons to arm its defenders. Quality work.”

The market was a lively place, filled with an assortment of traders and vendors, each offering something different. The group moved through the bustling stalls, taking in the sights and smells of the underground commerce.

At the orc’s stall, Silvius eyed the displayed weapons. “Got anything powerful or unusual?” he asked.

Umak Goz, the burly orc vendor, chuckled. “Most of what I have is standard, but…” He leaned in conspiratorially. “I do have something fun. Real and fake manacles.”

Silvius grinned. “I like options. I’ll take both.”

Czolg and Oscorn inquired about shields, and Umak promised to check his storage. “Come back tomorrow. I’ll have something for you.”

Next, they visited Glubglub, the enthusiastic kuo-toa merchant selling hunting and fishing gear. Silvius, ever curious, asked, “I haven’t seen much water around here. Is there really fishing?”

“Oh yes!” Glubglub beamed. “Plenty of fishing if you know where to look. Hunting, too.”

Silvius pressed further. “Any good spots between here and the Great City?”

Glubglub nodded excitedly. “The barge isn’t what it used to be, but east and west of here, there are still good spots. Most go by boat.” His eyes glinted with warning. “You must be careful. The river flows to the Sunless Sea. If you’re not careful, you’ll end up there.”

Silvius frowned. “The surface ocean?”

Glubglub shook his head. “Different one. The Sunless Sea. It’ll carry you away. Best to stay on land.”

At Stanmore’s Emporium, the eccentric human merchant greeted them with enthusiasm. “This is a sight to see!”

Silvius chuckled. “I agree.”

Stanmore’s wares included pocket watches, perfumes, intricate boxes, and a collection of sparkling rocks. He gestured proudly. “Ah, my best seller—flashbangs.”

Silvius wasted no time. “I’ll take all six.”

As they finalized their trade, Stanmore grinned. “Why pay more? Visit Stanmore’s!”

Silvius laughed and added, “Why pay more? Check out Stanmore! Wares of wonder, spells of lore! From potions deep to trinkets grand, finest goods in all the land!”

Stanmore clapped along, delighted. “Well said, traveler!”

At the apothecary stall, Falleron the drow inspected Silvius’ Potion of Diminution with wide eyes. “Where did you get this?”

Kalinar remained vague. “We’ve been many places.”

Falleron’s voice lowered. “Are you willing to part with it?”

Silvius nodded. “Apples to apples.”

Falleron led them to a back room, presenting various potions. “Antitoxins, climbing potions, gaseous form, alchemist’s fire…”

Oscorn picked up the antitoxins. “These could be useful.”

After a brief negotiation, the team secured potions of greater healing and various supplies.

Their final stop was the book stall, run by a drow trader with a pin of bone, marking her as a trader from House Eclavdra—the house that had sent giants to the surface.

Oscorn perused her collection. “Anything on politics or history?”

She retrieved a book. “A heritage book on Elserves and Everhate.”

Oscorn handed over his parchment in trade. “I’ll take it.”

Silvius, always one for stories, inquired, “Can I trade a fiction book for a fiction book?”

The trader smiled. “Of course.”

Silvius exchanged a copy of Tales of the Giants for a drow novel, then ordered vials of glowing, invisible, and stink ink along with a fine quill.

With each deal struck, Operation Trundle Wagon further ingrained themselves in the warrens, weaving their names into the underground currents of trade and power. The market had so far provided them with supplies, information, and new connections—but it also raised new questions. What lay ahead in the vault? Who truly ruled the Great City? And what role did Asperdis play in the shadows of the underdark?
