Operation Trundle Wagon gathered to discuss what they might want to trade in the Underdark market within the Warrens. They pooled their items, determining they could offer:

Silvius: A potion of poison, a potion of fire giant mind control, a potion of diminution, a +1 shortsword, and a scroll of heat metal.

Czolg: A potion of heroism.

Oscorn: A scroll of protection against undead.

Kalinar: A scroll of tongues, a scroll of Tasha’s Hideous Laughter, and their most prized possession, a vorpal scimitar. The group believed this scimitar could be their key to securing a meeting with Asperdis.

Fenurris had nothing to trade but was keen to see what was available.

In return, they sought specific items:

Oscorn: A better shield.

Czolg: A better shield.

Kalinar: Nothing specific but open to anything of interest.

Fennuris: Nothing.

Silvius: Mithril half plate.

Beyond their main objectives, they remained open to any rare or useful finds.

As they prepared, Czolg questioned their two drow companions, Talindra and Xilrath, about the Great City. Xilrath explained, "It’s the city of the drow. The home of the drow. Most are worshipers of Lolth. The battle right now between the houses is because there is a belief that one house should be in charge. The belief differs among the houses."

Silvius eyed them curiously. "What do you believe?"

Xilrath hesitated before replying. "We want to get out of it. We just want to live our lives. We hope trade will get us out with enough money. Once, we ran into a beholder."

Czolg, ever curious, leaned in. "What is in the vault?"

The two drow exchanged glances, confusion flickering across their faces.

"Vault?..." Talindra murmured. The two stepped away for a hushed discussion before returning. Xilrath clarified, "The vault isn’t a safe place to store things. It’s a chamber that contains the drow—that includes the Great City. The vault itself… there are different academies, different trading areas, mining businesses, and other companies. As you head north to the Great Wall, you reach the city. Beyond the river are the houses. The houses protect the Fane of Lolth, where the queen resides… the Spider Queen."

"How far is the vault from here?" Czolg pressed.

"You came past the checkpoint…" Kalinar mused.

Xilrath nodded. "You are about a third of the way to the vault. How have you found your way around?"

"One step at a time," Kalinar answered with a smirk. "You’ve been quite lucky. You seem to be on the right path."

Czolg, still hungry for knowledge, asked, "We hear there is a forge in the vault. Any more details on that?"

Xilrath shrugged. "The city does have forges, of course. To make weapons to protect the city."

"How welcoming is the city? If traders are accepted, maybe we would be too?" Czolg suggested.

"Most are drow, but others stay if they have use," Xilrath admitted.

Kalinar then inquired about the Black Guardians, but Xilrath only grew suspicious. "Who said anything about Black Guardians?"

"We heard it’s a route," Kalinar responded cautiously.

"Do you know where they reside?"

"We only heard it was on the way, past the drow gate," Kalinar admitted.

Czolg pivoted to a new topic. "And the Shrine of Kuo-Toa?"

Xilrath pointed down a hallway. "That is their home. We don’t mess with them. We let them do their thing. They have powers that cannot be fathomed."

Kalinar raised a brow. "We heard they worship large gods."

Xilrath’s gaze darkened. "They make gods."

With that sobering thought lingering, Czolg shifted the conversation to the river crossing. "Can you tell us about the river crossing?"

Xilrath responded, "The Swarvejet?" The team collectively struggled to pronounce it properly, each attempting their own variations—"Swarmjet," "Smarjit," "Suavejetty"—to Xilrath’s clear amusement.

"Last I knew, the crossing was a toll bridge," he explained. "Maybe it has changed."

"What was the toll before?" Silvius asked.

"Just some money. It’s a smaller market, so maybe it's different this time. I’m sure they will explain it to you."

Before heading into the market, the team noticed Shadowscar growing nervous. Silvius gently placed Czolg’s arm around Shadowscar and reassured him, "The big guy will take care of you."

They entered the bustling market filled with drow, kuo-toa, bugbears, hobgoblins, and orcs, all chattering and trading. The team lined up to speak with Dana. Shadowscar instinctively tucked himself close to Oscorn.

"Oh, you arrived," Dana greeted them.

"We have!" Silvius replied with enthusiasm.

"I know we need to talk, but I have matters to attend to here for now. As a show of trust to the Warrens, we know you have things, but we will let you pass."

Each member of OTW had a similar exchange with Dana before they fully entered the market. They took stock of the available vendors:

A female drow selling tools.

A male drow selling apothecary goods.

A kuo-toa preparing and serving exotic food.

An orc with a stall full of weapons and armor.

Another kuo-toa selling hunting and fishing gear.

A drow with books, writings, and parchments.

A human merchant with a mishmash of trinkets and flea market-style goods.

Their first stop was the orc’s stall.

"Oye, what can I help you with?" the orc asked, introducing himself as Umak Goz.

Silvius inquired about powerful or unusual items, but Umak admitted, "I only have standard weapons. But I do have something fun—real and fake manacles."

Silvius smirked. "I like options. I’ll take both."

They discussed shields and light armor, striking a tentative deal, with Umak promising, "I’ll do the manacles for 72 gold if you come back tomorrow."

Their next stop was Glubglub, the kuo-toa vendor. "Oh, there is great fishing to be found around here," he exclaimed excitedly.

Silvius, skeptical, asked, "Fishing gear? I haven’t seen anywhere for fishing."

"You have to know where to look!" Glubglub boasted, naming various deep-dwelling fish.

"If you’re interested in fishing down here, you need a boat," he warned. "The river runs all the way to the Sunless Sea, and if you’re not careful, you’ll end up there."

They moved to Stanmore’s Emporium, where they exchanged playful banter with the eccentric merchant and bought all six of his prized flashbangs for 400 gold.

The team then visited Falleron, the apothecary, where Silvius bartered his rare potion of diminution for a selection of potions, including greater healing and antitoxins.

Finally, they approached the book vendor, where Oscorn traded for a drow heritage book. Silvius exchanged one of their adventure books for another reading tome and purchased various specialty inks.

With their trading complete, they regrouped, preparing for the next leg of their journey.
