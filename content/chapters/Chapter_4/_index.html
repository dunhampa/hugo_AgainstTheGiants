As Silvius and Oscorn approached the Drow, they eloquently explained their purpose. They claimed to be traders who had heard from members of the House of Despana about a burgeoning market in these depths. With the Drow gaining prominence, they sought to establish trade on behalf of both their peoples, fostering cooperation and prosperity.

The Drow, named Rizon and Yuimar, listened attentively. They shared insights about the market, mentioning its enigmatic overseer, Asperdis. Asperdis had managed to create a delicate peace among the Drow, Trolls, and Trogs, fostering a prosperous environment. Rizon revealed that they were on a mission to clear the passages of oozes ahead, making the routes safer for trade. He emphasized the importance of bashing the oozes, as any other method would only spawn more of the troublesome creatures.

The team, known as Operation Trundle Wagon (OTR), informed Rizon that they had already encountered and dispatched many oozes. Grateful for their assistance, Rizon thanked them and, as a token of appreciation, offered a black medallion. This medallion would serve as a symbol of safe passage for minor checkpoints, although Rizon cautioned that it wouldn't be effective at larger fortresses.
