Czlog was a barbarian fighter who followed the path of the totem warrior. Born into a tribe of fierce warriors in the lands of Aerdy, Czolg was trained from a young age in the ways of combat and the natural world. As a spirit seeker's rite of passage, Czolg befriended an elderly bear who taught him to be hardened in defense and reckless in rage. Upon the bear's death, Czolg ate his heart, imbuing him with thickened-skin. Czolg kept a tooth from the bear, adopting the totem spirit of the bear. As he grew older and stronger, Czlog became known as the Behemoth Defender of Aerdy, a title earned through his countless battles and fierce loyalty to his people.

When King Ivid the Fifth took the throne, Czlog pledged his loyalty to the new ruler, serving as a defender and trial by combat for the kingdom. Ivid the Fifth was a cruel and ruthless ruler, known for his brutality and cunning. He inherited the throne of Aerdy after a bloody succession struggle in which he eliminated all 123 of his siblings, including his older brother, to secure his claim to the throne.

To solidify his power, Ivid V turned to nefarious means, bribing and manipulating those around him to do his bidding. He was particularly fond of using his favorite concubine to carry out his dirty work, often tasking her with carrying out deadly assassinations or spreading rumors and lies to undermine his enemies. 

Unbeknownst to Czlog, King Ivid the Fifth resorted to dark and malevolent methods. Driven by his thirst for power and dominance, the king sought out a group of captive giants, whom he cruelly tortured and manipulated to extract their magical essence.

In his twisted experiments, Ivid subjected the giants to unimaginable torment, harnessing their pain and suffering to imbue his loyal defender, Czlog, with their otherworldly powers. The king's malevolence knew no bounds as he forcibly extracted the magic from the giants, leaving them broken and drained.

As a result of this agonizing process, Czlog found himself infused with the might of the giants. The magic within him granted him the incredible ability to assume a towering form, expanding his size and strength to extraordinary levels. Whenever he unleashed this power, Czlog became a behemoth among mortals, capable of toppling enemies with sheer force and causing the earth to tremble beneath his colossal feet.

But it wasn't just the giants' size and strength that he acquired; it was the ancient art of runes that truly set him apart. From the depths of King Ivid's cruel and malevolent torture, Czlog harnessed the power of runes. The pain-inflicted experiments had imbued powerful runic stones, taken from the giants' artifacts, into his possession, allowing him to command supernatural energies.

Despite his cruel and selfish actions, Ivid V was able to maintain his hold on the throne for many years, thanks in part to his skilled and loyal defenders like Czlog. Through his strength, courage, and unwavering loyalty, Czlog became one of the most battle-tested fighters in all of Aerdy, feared and respected by enemies and allies alike.

As the Greyhawk war raged on, the atrocities of war had shattered his faith in any fixed sense of morality, and he embraced the unpredictability of his actions. He would aid those in need, seeking to protect the innocent from harm, but he would also resort to ruthless tactics to survive. Czolg's loyalty to King Ivid the Fifth was severely tested. While battling on the frontlines, Czolg's absence from the capital allowed the opportunity for the treacherous knights of doom to take his place as the king's personal guard, ultimately betraying him in the process.

The knights of doom were formidable foes, their bodies enhanced by magical rituals and their minds completely devoted to serving the Overking. They were skilled warriors and were feared on the battlefield for their unyielding loyalty and brutal fighting style. Their armor was made of a shimmering black metal, and they wielded powerful magical weapons imbued with dark energies. Some say that the knights of doom were not truly alive, but rather animated constructs controlled by the will of Xaene and the Overking. Regardless of their true nature, the knights of doom were a force to be reckoned with and were feared by all who opposed them.

Despite his reservations, Czlog knew that he had a duty to his kingdom. So he fought alongside the knights of doom, fighting against the rebel forces and the invading armies of the Great Kingdom.

But as the war intensified, Czlog began to see the true nature of the knights of doom and the dark magic they wielded. He saw the way they played with the lives of those around them, using their magic to manipulate and control those they deemed weaker.

As the war came to a close and the Great Kingdom was defeated, Czlog knew that he could no longer serve a king who would condone such actions. So he left the monarchy and became a mercenary, fighting for whoever would hire him and using his skills to protect those who needed it. Czlog embraced the life of a wandering warrior, seeking fresh paths to safeguard his people while also guarding his own interests.

Czlog eventually joined forces with Herzog Grenell of the North Province, who was rebelling against the Overking. Czlog threw himself into the fight against the giants, determined to do everything in his power to protect his people and his land.

As he fought alongside Herzog Grenell, becoming a loyal member of Grenell's army, and eventually rose through the ranks to become one of his most trusted advisers.

Now, as the giant invasion threatens to tear apart the land, Czlog has been called upon to help Herzog Grenell unite the fractured provinces and drive back the giant threat. He knows that this will be a difficult and dangerous task, but he is determined to do whatever it takes to protect his people and restore peace to the land.
